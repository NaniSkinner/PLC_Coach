# Phoenix Academy: Complete School Transformation

## Context

**Phoenix Academy High School** - Grades 9-12, 850 students, urban
**Starting Point (2019):** State's lowest-performing high schools list

**2019 Baseline:**
- Graduation rate: 64%
- College readiness: 18%
- Chronic absenteeism: 42%
- Teacher turnover: 55% annually
- State intervention threatened

---

## Five-Year Journey (2019-2024)

### Year 1 (2019-2020): Crisis & Foundation

**New Principal Dr. Martinez hired with turnaround experience**

**Initial Diagnosis:**
- No collaborative structures
- Each teacher different standards/expectations
- No intervention systems
- Students "passing" without learning

**Foundation Building:**
- Established department PLCs
- Protected 90 minutes weekly
- Intensive PD on PLC foundations
- Developed department norms

**Year 1 Results:** Modest improvements, strong structures established

---

### Year 2 (2020-2021): Assessment & Data

**Focus:** Common formative assessments across departments

**Developments:**
- All core departments developed CFAs
- Data analysis protocols implemented
- Revealed huge inconsistencies in grading/expectations

**Breakthrough:** Realizing 50% of students "passing" classes weren't learning grade-level content

**Year 2 Results:**
- Initial drop in grades (higher standards)
- But: More accurate picture of student learning

---

### Year 3 (2021-2022): Intervention Systems

**Focus:** Systematic response to struggling students

**Structures Created:**
- Daily intervention block (advisory period repurposed)
- Credit recovery lab
- Tier 2 and Tier 3 supports
- Academic contracts for failing students

**Year 3 Results:**
- Graduation rate: 64% → 72%
- Students recovering credits at higher rates

---

### Year 4 (2022-2023): Extension & Excellence

**Focus:** Not just preventing failure, but pushing excellence

**New Initiatives:**
- AP course expansion
- Dual enrollment partnerships
- Extension during intervention block for proficient students
- College/career readiness programming

**Year 4 Results:**
- Graduation rate: 72% → 81%
- College readiness: 18% → 34%

---

### Year 5 (2023-2024): Sustained Excellence

**Status:** PLCs embedded in school culture

**Outcomes:**
- Graduation rate: 89% (25-point gain from baseline)
- College readiness: 47% (29-point gain)
- Chronic absenteeism: 42% → 22%
- Teacher retention: 45% → 82%
- Removed from state intervention list

**State Recognition:** Phoenix Academy named "Turnaround School of the Year"

---

## Key Success Factors

1. **Sustained Leadership:** Dr. Martinez stayed all 5 years (consistency matters)
2. **Protected Time:** Never compromised on collaborative time
3. **Systematic Implementation:** Year 1 foundation, Year 2 assessment, Year 3 intervention, Year 4 extension
4. **Staff Changes:** Moved out teachers unwilling to participate in collaborative culture
5. **Student Voice:** Students involved in goal-setting and progress monitoring
6. **Community Partnerships:** Local businesses, college partners engaged

---

## Current Status (2024-2025)

**Phoenix Academy is now a model school:**
- Hosting site visits from struggling schools
- Teachers presenting at state conferences
- Featured in district communications
- Students/parents choosing to attend (used to avoid)

**Dr. Martinez:** "Five years ago we were on the brink of closure. Today we're proof that focused, collaborative work transforms outcomes. PLCs didn't just change test scores - they changed lives."

## Reflection: What Made Phoenix Different?

**Not unique challenges - many schools face similar contexts**

**What made difference:**
- Commitment to PLC process (not just lip service)
- Willingness to make hard decisions
- Persistence through difficulty
- Belief that all students could succeed

**Lesson:** Even schools in crisis can transform through systematic PLC implementation

## Reflection Questions

1. How did Phoenix pace implementation over 5 years?
2. What role did leadership stability play?
3. Why did graduation rates take 3 years to show significant improvement?
4. What lessons transfer to schools not in crisis?
