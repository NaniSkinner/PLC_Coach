# Coaching Scenario: Unpacking Reading Comprehension Standards

## Context

Marcus is a 7th-grade ELA teacher whose team has just identified "Cite textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text" as one of their essential standards. The team is now trying to "unpack" this standard to understand what proficiency really means, but they're finding it more difficult than expected.

**Team Composition:**
- 3 seventh-grade ELA teachers
- All teaching same novel units and essay assignments
- Team in second year of PLC work
- Have identified essential standards but struggle with assessment

**Current Situation:**
- Team agreed on 12 essential ELA standards for the year
- Currently planning instruction for first quarter
- Upcoming unit on analyzing fiction
- Need to create common formative assessment but unclear what to assess
- Team meeting scheduled for tomorrow

## The Coaching Conversation

### Turn 1: Teacher Opens

**Marcus:** Our team is stuck. We identified this citing textual evidence standard as essential, and we all agreed it's critical. But now we're trying to plan our first common assessment for our fiction unit, and we're realizing we don't actually agree on what this standard means.

One teacher thinks it's about finding quotes. Another thinks it's about making inferences. And I'm not sure if we're supposed to assess literal comprehension or analytical skills or both. The standard says "explicitly" AND "inferences" but what does proficient performance actually look like?

**Coach's Purpose:** Acknowledge complexity, validate that unpacking is harder than it looks, introduce systematic unpacking process.

**Coach Response:**

Marcus, you've just discovered what many teams discover: identifying essential standards is the easy part. Unpacking them - truly understanding what proficiency looks like - is where the real work begins. And the fact that your team doesn't agree on what this standard means? That's actually very common and it's good you discovered this now rather than after you've all taught and assessed it differently.

Let's unpack this standard systematically. When I look at your standard - "Cite textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text" - I see several components. Let me show you how to break it down:

First, what are the **key verbs**? What actions must students perform?
- "Cite" (locate and reference)
- "Support" (use evidence to justify)
- "Analyze" (examine and explain)

Second, what are the **key concepts** students must understand?
- Textual evidence
- Explicit information vs. inferences
- Analysis vs. summary

Does your team have shared understanding of what these terms mean? For example, what's the difference between an "inference" and a "guess"?

---

### Turn 2: Teacher Responds with Partial Understanding

**Marcus:** I think we understand the terms generally, but we've never actually talked about the differences explicitly. Like, I know what an inference is - it's reading between the lines. But you're right, I'm not sure my teammates and I would define it the same way.

And I think that's part of our problem with the assessment. One teacher wants questions like "What evidence from the text supports the idea that the character is brave?" But another teacher thinks that's too easy because it tells students what to analyze. She wants more open-ended questions like "Analyze the character using textual evidence."

How do we decide what level of difficulty matches "proficient" for seventh grade?

**Coach's Purpose:** Help teacher see this isn't about difficulty level - it's about what the standard requires; introduce cognitive demand analysis.

**Coach Response:**

Great question, but let's reframe it slightly. It's not about "difficulty" - it's about what cognitive work the standard requires. Both of those questions you mentioned could assess this standard, but they assess different aspects at different depths.

Let me show you how to analyze cognitive demand. Your standard has three levels embedded in it:

**Level 1: Locating Evidence ("what the text says explicitly")**
Cognitive demand: Recognition and recall
Example: "Which quote shows the character is brave?"
This is the foundation but not the full standard.

**Level 2: Making Inferences ("inferences drawn from the text")**
Cognitive demand: Analysis and reasoning
Example: "What can you infer about the character's motivation? Support with evidence."
This requires going beyond literal text.

**Level 3: Using Evidence to Support Analysis ("cite evidence to support analysis")**
Cognitive demand: Synthesis and justification
Example: "Analyze how the character changes. Use specific textual evidence to support your analysis."
This is the complete standard in action.

Proficiency on this standard requires students to do all three levels, not just one. So here's my question: If you gave your students a task requiring all three levels, what would proficient work include? What would it look like?

---

### Turn 3: Teacher Attempts to Define Proficiency

**Marcus:** Okay, so if I'm thinking about all three levels... A proficient seventh grader would need to:

1. Find specific quotes or examples from the text - not just summarize or give page numbers
2. Make an inference that goes beyond what's directly stated
3. Explain how the evidence supports their inference or analysis

So if the task was "Analyze how the character changes throughout the story," a proficient response would need specific quotes, an inference about WHY the character changed or what it means, and an explanation connecting the evidence to the inference?

**Coach's Purpose:** Affirm his thinking, help him see he's described criteria for proficiency, introduce rubric thinking.

**Coach Response:**

Excellent! You've just articulated the criteria for proficiency. Now let's make this even more concrete by contrasting proficiency with what's below and above it. This is how you develop a rubric. Let me show you:

**Below Proficient:**
- Summarizes rather than analyzes
- Provides little or no textual evidence
- Makes claims without connecting them to text
- Confuses inference with opinion or guess

**Proficient (what you just described):**
- Identifies specific textual evidence (quotes, examples)
- Makes reasonable inferences based on text
- Explains connection between evidence and claim
- Analysis is text-based, not opinion-based

**Advanced:**
- Synthesizes multiple pieces of evidence
- Makes sophisticated, nuanced inferences
- Analyzes how literary elements contribute to meaning
- Considers multiple interpretations supported by text

Now, here's what I'm curious about: If you showed these three levels to your team, would you all agree on where a student work sample falls? Or would you still score differently?

---

### Turn 4: Teacher Recognizes Need for Calibration

**Marcus:** I think we'd probably still score differently, honestly. We might agree on the obvious ones - like a student who writes a paragraph with no evidence is clearly below proficient. But the ones in the middle? Where there's some evidence but maybe not enough analysis? I bet we'd disagree on those.

Is there a way to get our scoring more consistent? Because if we're giving common assessments but scoring them differently, we're not really getting useful data, are we?

**Coach's Purpose:** Affirm his insight, introduce calibration process, provide concrete protocol.

**Coach Response:**

You've identified the exact problem, Marcus, and you're absolutely right - inconsistent scoring makes common assessment data unreliable. The solution is called "calibration" or "anchor paper scoring." Here's how it works:

**Calibration Process:**

**Step 1: Collect Anonymous Student Work (Before your meeting)**
Gather 6-8 student responses to a task requiring this standard. Make copies without names. Select work representing a range of quality.

**Step 2: Individual Scoring (15 minutes)**
Each teacher independently reads all samples and sorts them into three piles:
- Below Proficient
- Proficient
- Advanced

**Step 3: Compare Sorting (20 minutes)**
Put all teachers' sorts side by side. Where did you agree? Where did you disagree?

**Step 4: Discuss Disagreements (30 minutes)**
For each sample where people disagreed, discuss:
- "What makes you say this is proficient?"
- "What would this student need to add to move up?"
- "What specifically is missing for proficiency?"

**Step 5: Reach Consensus (15 minutes)**
Agree on final placement for each sample and WHY it belongs there.

These become your "anchor papers" - examples you can refer back to when scoring future assessments. You're essentially creating a shared mental model of what proficiency looks like.

Would your team be willing to do this calibration exercise? You could use student work from last year's similar assignment.

---

### Turn 5: Teacher Sees Value but Has Practical Question

**Marcus:** That makes total sense. I think my team would definitely do this - we've been frustrated that we score differently. I have some student essays from last year's character analysis assignment I could use.

But here's what I'm wondering: Once we calibrate and agree on what proficiency looks like, how do we communicate that to students? I mean, we can't show them other students' work because of privacy. And when I've tried to explain rubrics before, students just kind of glaze over.

How do we help students understand what we're looking for before they complete the assessment?

**Coach's Purpose:** Connect unpacking standards to student-friendly learning targets, introduce transparent assessment practices.

**Coach Response:**

Fantastic question! You're absolutely right that understanding proficiency can't just live in teachers' heads - students need to understand it too. Let me give you two powerful strategies:

**Strategy 1: Student-Friendly Learning Targets**

Transform your standard into language students can understand:

**Standard:** "Cite textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text"

**Student-Friendly Target:**
"I can analyze a text by:
- Using specific quotes and examples from the text as evidence
- Making inferences (educated guesses) based on clues in the text
- Explaining how my evidence supports my analysis"

Post this in your classroom. Reference it during instruction. Ask students to self-assess against it.

**Strategy 2: Models and Non-Models**

Create your own sample responses (not real student work) showing different levels:

**Model A (Below Proficient):** Short paragraph with no quotes, just opinion
**Model B (Proficient):** Paragraph with specific quotes, clear inference, explanation
**Model C (Advanced):** Multiple paragraphs synthesizing evidence, sophisticated analysis

Show these to students BEFORE the assessment. Ask them: "What makes Model B stronger than Model A? What would you need to do to move from B to C?"

This makes your expectations transparent. Students aren't guessing what you want - they can see it.

Does that give you practical ways to share your unpacked standard with students?

---

### Turn 6: Teacher Connects to Instruction

**Marcus:** Yes! I love the idea of showing them models. That feels way more helpful than a rubric with vague language like "adequate evidence" or "thorough analysis."

This is also making me think about my instruction. If proficiency requires students to cite evidence, make inferences, AND explain connections, then I probably need to teach each of those skills explicitly, right? I can't just assign an essay and hope they figure it out.

What's the connection between unpacking the standard and planning instruction? Am I supposed to teach to the rubric?

**Coach's Purpose:** Affirm connection between unpacking and instruction, introduce backward design concept.

**Coach Response:**

Marcus, you've just made the most important connection! Yes - unpacking standards absolutely shapes instruction. This is called "backward design":

1. **Start with the end:** What does proficiency look like? (You've defined this)
2. **Determine assessment:** How will we know if students reached proficiency? (Your common assessment)
3. **Plan instruction:** What skills and knowledge do students need to reach proficiency? (Your lessons)

So for your standard, students need to learn:
- **Skill 1:** How to select relevant textual evidence (not just any quote)
- **Skill 2:** How to make text-based inferences (not wild guesses)
- **Skill 3:** How to explain the connection between evidence and claim

Each of these could be a mini-lesson with guided practice before you ever assign the full analytical essay. You're not "teaching to the rubric" in a negative way - you're teaching students exactly what they need to succeed.

Here's my question: If you taught each of those three skills explicitly and gave students practice, how would that change your typical instruction for this unit?

---

### Turn 7: Teacher Reflects on Instructional Changes

**Marcus:** Wow, that would actually change a lot. Usually, I teach the book - we read it together, discuss themes and characters, and then I assign the essay. I might do a mini-lesson on thesis statements, but I don't explicitly teach how to select evidence or explain connections.

I'm realizing that maybe my students struggle not because the content is too hard, but because I've never taught them the specific skills the standard requires. I've just expected them to know how to do analysis.

So if I'm understanding correctly, the sequence would be:
1. Unpack the standard as a team (define proficiency)
2. Create student-friendly learning targets
3. Plan explicit instruction for each component skill
4. Give formative assessments along the way
5. Teach students what proficiency looks like with models
6. Then administer the common assessment

Is that the right order?

**Coach's Purpose:** Affirm his sequence, connect to PLC cycle, reinforce how unpacking enables everything else.

**Coach Response:**

Marcus, that sequence is perfect! You've just outlined the complete path from unpacking standards to assessing student learning. And you've identified something crucial: teachers often assume students have skills they've never explicitly taught. Unpacking helps us see exactly what we need to teach.

Let me show you how this fits into the full PLC cycle:

**Question 1: What do we want students to learn?**
- Identify essential standard ✓
- Unpack the standard (define proficiency) ✓
- Create student-friendly learning targets ✓

**Question 2: How will we know when they've learned it?**
- Design common formative assessment (based on proficiency criteria)
- Calibrate scoring using anchor papers

**Question 3: What will we do when they don't learn it?**
- Plan intervention based on which specific skill students lack

**Question 4: What will we do when they already know it?**
- Plan extension requiring deeper analysis or more complex texts

See how unpacking the standard is the foundation for everything? Without clarity on what proficiency means, you can't design good assessments, target intervention, or plan instruction effectively.

Now, here's my question: Are you ready to lead your team through this unpacking process for this standard? What support would you need?

---

### Turn 8: Teacher Commits to Action with Team

**Marcus:** I think I am ready. Actually, I'm excited to bring this to my team because I think it'll solve the confusion we've been having.

Here's my plan for tomorrow's meeting:
1. Start by having everyone write their own definition of what proficiency means for this standard
2. Compare our definitions and notice where we differ
3. Use that calibration protocol you described with the student work I have
4. Develop our rubric based on what we learn from the anchor papers
5. Create student-friendly learning targets together
6. Then backwards plan our instruction

I'm also going to suggest we do this unpacking process for all 12 of our essential standards, not just this one. It'll take time, but if we do one per meeting, we'll have them all unpacked by winter break.

Does that sound reasonable? And would you be willing to check in with me after our team meeting to see how it went?

**Coach's Purpose:** Affirm his plan, offer adjustment, provide encouragement, confirm follow-up.

**Coach Response:**

Marcus, your plan is excellent and your timeline is realistic. Unpacking one standard per meeting is very doable, and having all 12 unpacked by winter break gives you a strong foundation for the rest of the year.

One small adjustment to your meeting plan: I'd suggest doing the calibration activity (Step 3) BEFORE people write their individual definitions. Here's why - looking at actual student work often surfaces assumptions we didn't know we had. After examining real work samples and discussing what proficiency looks like in practice, your definitions will be more grounded and specific.

So revised order:
1. Review the standard together
2. Calibrate with student work samples (discuss what proficiency looks like in practice)
3. Based on calibration, draft your rubric together
4. Create student-friendly learning targets
5. Backward plan instruction

Also, I love that you're thinking beyond this one standard. That shows real leadership. One suggestion: Once you unpack a few standards, you might notice patterns. Many ELA standards require similar skills - citing evidence, analyzing, explaining. This will make later unpacking faster.

I'm absolutely willing to check in after your meeting. I'm curious to hear how your team responds to the calibration process and whether it creates the clarity you're hoping for.

You've got this, Marcus. Your team is lucky to have someone thinking this deeply about what proficiency really means.
