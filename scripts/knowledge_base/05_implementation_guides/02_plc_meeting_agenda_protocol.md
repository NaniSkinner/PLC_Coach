# PLC Meeting Agenda Protocol and Template

## Purpose of Meeting Agendas

Effective PLC meetings require clear agendas that focus time on student learning. Without agendas, meetings drift into logistics, announcements, and unfocused conversation. A good agenda ensures productive use of limited collaborative time.

## Components of Effective PLC Agendas

**Every agenda should include:**

1. **Date, Time, Location** - Basic logistics
2. **Team Norms** - Posted at top as reminder
3. **Learning Focus** - What student learning question drives this meeting?
4. **Time Allocations** - Minutes for each agenda item
5. **Agenda Items** - Specific topics in order
6. **Meeting Roles** - Who facilitates, records, monitors time?
7. **Preparation Required** - What should members bring/review before meeting?
8. **Expected Products** - What will team produce/decide?
9. **Next Meeting Preview** - What's coming next time?

## Tips for Effective Agenda Use

### Before the Meeting

**Create Agenda in Advance (2-3 days before)**
- Allows team to prepare
- Shows respect for members' time
- Increases meeting productivity

**Email Agenda with Attachments**
- Include any data, articles, or documents to review
- Clearly state what preparation is expected
- Send reminder day before meeting

### During the Meeting

**Start by Reviewing Agenda**
- Confirm time allocations work for everyone
- Make any needed adjustments
- Get commitment to follow agenda

**Post Agenda Visibly**
- Display on screen or chart paper
- Allows team to track progress
- Facilitator can point to it when redirecting

**Use Timekeeper**
- Alerts when time is running out (5 min, 2 min, time's up)
- Helps team decide: extend discussion or move on?
- Keeps meeting on track

**Record Decisions and Action Items**
- What was decided?
- Who is doing what?
- By when?
- This creates accountability

### After the Meeting

**Distribute Meeting Notes**
- Include decisions made
- Include action items with names and dates
- Preview next meeting
- Send within 24 hours

**Begin Next Meeting by Reviewing Previous Action Items**
- "Last time we agreed to X. How did it go?"
- Creates culture of accountability
- Shows that commitments matter

## Common Agenda Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: No Agenda**
Problem: Meeting meanders, time wasted, nothing accomplished
Solution: Always have agenda, even if brief

**Pitfall 2: Too Much on Agenda**
Problem: Try to cover 10 items in 60 minutes, everything gets surface treatment
Solution: Limit to 3-4 substantive items. Better to go deep on few things than shallow on many.

**Pitfall 3: Logistics Dominate**
Problem: Spend 45 minutes on field trip permission slips, 15 minutes on student learning
Solution: Handle logistics via email. Reserve meeting time for collaborative work on learning.

**Pitfall 4: No Time Allocations**
Problem: First item takes 45 minutes, never get to other important items
Solution: Assign time to each item. Use timekeeper. Make trade-offs explicit.

**Pitfall 5: Hidden Agenda**
Problem: Leader has decision already made, "agenda" is just going through motions
Solution: If seeking input, genuinely be open. If decision is made, say so and explain why.

## Rotating Meeting Roles

**Facilitator** (rotates monthly)
- Prepares agenda
- Guides discussion
- Keeps focus on student learning
- Manages participation

**Recorder** (rotates weekly)
- Takes notes on decisions
- Records action items
- Distributes notes after meeting

**Timekeeper** (rotates weekly)
- Monitors time for each agenda item
- Alerts team when time running short
- Helps team make decisions about extending discussion

**Norms Monitor** (rotates weekly)
- Observes team adherence to norms
- Provides feedback at meeting end
- Not punitive - helps team improve

**Benefits of rotation:**
- Develops leadership capacity in all members
- Prevents one person from dominating
- Shares workload
- Builds ownership

## Checklist for Quality Agendas

Does your agenda include:
- [ ] Clear learning focus question?
- [ ] Specific time allocations for each item?
- [ ] Defined roles (facilitator, recorder, etc.)?
- [ ] Expected products/outcomes for each item?
- [ ] Preparation expectations stated clearly?
- [ ] Action items section to capture commitments?
- [ ] Preview of next meeting?
- [ ] Team norms displayed?

Is your agenda:
- [ ] Sent 2-3 days in advance?
- [ ] Focused on student learning (not just logistics)?
- [ ] Realistic for time available (not overpacked)?
- [ ] Specific enough that people know what to expect?

## Next Steps

- [ ] Select agenda template to use
- [ ] Determine who creates agenda (facilitator? rotating?)
- [ ] Establish routine for distributing agenda (email? shared drive?)
- [ ] Assign meeting roles
- [ ] Plan rotation schedule for roles
- [ ] Create shared folder for storing agendas and notes
- [ ] Commit to always having agenda (no exceptions)

---

**Remember:** An hour without an agenda often produces little. An hour with a clear agenda focused on student learning produces meaningful improvement.
