# Coaching Scenario: Designing First Common Formative Assessment

## Context

Rachel teaches 6th-grade science and her team has just completed unpacking their essential standard on "understanding the relationship between structure and function in living systems." They know what proficiency looks like conceptually, but they've never created a common formative assessment before. They're unsure what format to use, how many questions to include, and how to ensure all the questions actually align to their standard.

## The Coaching Conversation

### Turn 1: Teacher Opens

**Rachel:** Our team is ready to create our first common formative assessment, but we're kind of stuck. We have this standard about structure and function in living systems - like how a bird's wing structure supports its function of flight. We unpacked it and we know what we want students to understand. But now we need to actually write an assessment.

Do we use multiple choice? Short answer? Both? How many questions? And how do we make sure the questions really match what we unpacked? I don't want to just Google "structure and function assessment" and copy questions. We want this to actually assess OUR standard the way WE defined proficiency.

**Coach Response:**

Rachel, the fact that you want to design an assessment aligned to your specific definition of proficiency - not just grab random questions - shows you understand the purpose of CFAs. Let me give you a framework for assessment design that answers all your questions.

First principle: Your assessment format should match the cognitive demand of your standard. If your standard requires students to "analyze the relationship" between structure and function, then asking them to "identify which is a structure and which is a function" is too low-level. The assessment has to require the same thinking as the standard.

Let me ask: What cognitive work does your standard require students to do?

### Turn 2-8: [Conversation continues with coach helping Rachel understand:]

- **Backward design from the standard**: Assessment must match the cognitive demand (analyze relationships, not just identify parts)
- **Balance of item types**: Mix of selected response (efficient for breadth) and constructed response (reveals thinking depth)
- **Appropriate length**: 15-20 minutes for middle school CFA
- **Alignment check**: Every item must trace back to unpacked standard
- **Scoring criteria**: Agreement on what proficient responses look like before administering
- **Trial run**: Pilot with one class before full team administration
- **Common administration**: Same timing and conditions across classrooms
- **Item bank development**: Building reusable items over time

**Outcome:** Rachel leaves with clear blueprint for assessment design, understanding that creating quality CFAs is iterative work that improves over time. Team commits to creating draft assessment, each teacher writes 3-4 items, then team selects best items for final assessment.

## Coaching Analysis

### Key Coaching Moves
- Provided assessment design framework (backward from standard, match cognitive demand)
- Helped distinguish between assessing recall vs. analysis vs. application
- Addressed practical constraints (time, scoring feasibility)
- Normalized that first CFAs aren't perfect

### PLC Concepts Demonstrated
- Alignment between standards and assessment
- Collaborative assessment design
- Formative vs. summative purposes
- Quality over coverage

## Reflection Questions
1. How does backward design from standards improve assessment quality?
2. What makes a CFA different from a traditional quiz or test?
