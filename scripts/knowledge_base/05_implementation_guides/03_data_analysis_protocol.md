# Data Analysis Protocol Worksheet

## Purpose

This protocol guides teams through structured analysis of common formative assessment data, ensuring conversations stay focused, productive, and lead to actionable decisions.

## Protocol Overview (60 minutes)

| Step | Activity | Time | Purpose |
|------|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | Set Norms & Context | 5 min | Create psychological safety |
| 2 | Individual Prediction | 3 min | Surface assumptions |
| 3 | Silent Data Observation | 10 min | Notice before interpreting |

| 5 | Analysis & Inquiry | 20 min | Explore causes & patterns |
| 6 | Action Planning | 10 min | Decide next steps |
| 7 | Reflection | 2 min | Improve process |

---

## STEP 1: Set Norms & Context (5 minutes)

**Facilitator reminds team:**

**Data Analysis Norms:**
- We're here to learn, not judge
- Data describes performance, not defines people
- Everyone has strengths and areas for growth
- We share strategies generously
- Confidentiality - data stays in this room

**Assessment Context:**
- **Standard(s) assessed:** _________________________________________
- **Date administered:** _________________________________________
- **Number of items:** _________________________________________
- **Proficiency criteria:** _________________________________________
- **Any administration issues?** _________________________________________

---

## STEP 2: Individual Prediction (3 minutes)

**Before looking at data, each person privately writes:**

**My predictions:**

I predict ____% of my students demonstrated proficiency.

I predict the items/skills students struggled with most were:
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________

I predict students performed strongest on:
- _____________________________________________________

**My assumptions/concerns coming into this data review:**
_________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________

---

## STEP 3: Silent Data Observation (10 minutes)

**Facilitator displays data. Team members silently review and take notes.**

**Overall Proficiency Data:**
| Teacher | Students Tested | # Proficient | % Proficient |
|---------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
|         |                |              |              |
|         |                |              |              |
|         |                |              |              |
|         |                |              |              |
| **TOTAL** |              |              |              |

**Item-Level Data:**
| Item # | Standard/Skill | % Correct | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

**While observing silently, note:**

**I NOTICE** (observations, not interpretations):
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________

**I WONDER** (questions that arise):

## STEP 4: Collaborative Observation (15 minutes)

**Round-robin: Each person shares ONE observation (use "I notice..." language)**

**Team observations:**
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________

**Patterns we see:**
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________

**Questions that arise:**
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________

---

## STEP 5: Analysis & Inquiry (20 minutes)

**Discuss these questions:**

### Understanding Results

_________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________

**Where are students strong across all classrooms?**
_________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________

**Where do significant gaps exist?**
_________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________

### Exploring Causation

**What instructional decisions might have influenced these outcomes?**
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________

**For items/skills where students performed well, what did we do?**
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________

**For items/skills where students struggled, what factors might explain this?**
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________

**How did pacing affect student learning?**
_________________________________________________________

### Sharing Effective Practices

**Teachers with strong results: What approaches did you use?**
_________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________

**What strategies might transfer to other classrooms?**
_________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________

## STEP 6: Action Planning (10 minutes)

### Re-Teaching Decisions

**Which concepts need whole-class re-teaching?**
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________

**What alternative instructional approaches should we try?**
- _____________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________

**When will we re-assess these skills?** _______________

### Intervention (Question 3)

**Which students need Tier 2 intervention?**

| Student Name | Specific Skill Gap | Intervention Plan |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
|              |                   |                   |

## STEP 7: Reflection (2 minutes)

**How did our data analysis process go today?**
_________________________________________________________

**What helped us have a productive conversation?**
_________________________________________________________

**What should we do differently next time?**
_________________________________________________________

**Which norm did we live well today?**
_________________________________________________________

**Which norm should we focus on next time?**
_________________________________________________________

## Tips for Facilitators

### Keep Discussion Productive

**If conversation becomes defensive:**
"Let's return to our norm - we're here to learn, not judge. This is about what students need, not evaluation of teachers."

**If discussion goes off-track:**
"This is an interesting topic, but let's return to our student data. We can revisit this another time."

**If someone dominates:**
"Let's hear from others who haven't shared yet. What do you notice in the data?"

**If people avoid hard truths:**
"I notice we're talking around the data. Let's look directly at what it shows us."

### Ground Discussion in Evidence

**Less helpful:** "I think students didn't understand fractions."
**More helpful:** "75% of students missed item 7 on comparing fractions, which tells me they struggled with that concept."

**Less helpful:** "My students just don't try."
**More helpful:** "Looking at the pattern of responses, students attempted all items but showed specific misconceptions about X."

### Move to Action

**Don't stop at analysis.** Always end with concrete action items:
- Who needs intervention?
- What will we reteach?
- When will we reassess?
- Who is responsible for what?

## Alternative: Focused Data Protocol

**For teams with limited time, use this abbreviated version (30 minutes):**

| Step | Time |
|------|------|
| Context & Norms | 3 min |
| Review Data | 7 min |
| Identify 3 Key Findings | 10 min |
| Decide Actions | 10 min |
