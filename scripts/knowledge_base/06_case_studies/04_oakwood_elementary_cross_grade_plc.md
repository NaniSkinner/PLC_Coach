# Oakwood Elementary: Cross-Grade PLC for STEM Integration

## Context

**Oakwood Elementary** - K-5, 380 students, strong traditional PLC structures
**Challenge:** Wanted to integrate STEM across grades but lacked vertical alignment

**Problem (2023):**
- Each grade teaching science in isolation
- 3rd graders learning about rocks while 4th graders also taught rocks
- Concepts not building on each other
- No clear progression K-5

---

## The Innovation: Cross-Grade STEM PLC

**Fall 2023:** Principal proposed experiment:
Form cross-grade PLC (K-5 science/math lead teachers) focused on STEM curriculum alignment

**Membership:**
- 6 teachers (one from each grade K-5)
- Math specialist
- Science curriculum coordinator

**Meeting Time:** Monthly 90-minute sessions (in addition to regular grade-level PLCs)

---

## Process & Outcomes

### Phase 1: Mapping Current Curriculum (Sept-Oct)

**Activity:** Created visual map of what each grade taught
**Discovery:** Massive gaps and overlaps
- Grades 2, 3, 4 all taught basic weather
- No grade teaching forces/motion comprehensively
- Math-science connections random, not intentional

### Phase 2: Designing Aligned Sequence (Nov-Jan)

**Team developed K-5 progression:**
- K: Observing patterns in nature
- 1st: Properties of materials
- 2nd: Life cycles and habitats
- 3rd: Forces and motion
- 4th: Energy and resources
- 5th: Systems thinking and engineering design

**Each year builds on previous, no repetition**

### Phase 3: Creating Common Assessments (Feb-Apr)

**Developed performance tasks:**
- Hands-on assessments showing conceptual understanding
- Common rubrics K-5 (adapted for grade level)
- Portfolio system showing growth over time

### Results (Spring 2024):

**Student Outcomes:**
- Science proficiency: 64% → 78% (14-point gain in one year)
- Better retention of concepts (less reteaching needed)
- Students making cross-grade connections

**Teacher Feedback:**
- "Finally teaching makes sense - building on what students learned before"
- "Students coming to my grade better prepared"
- "Less repetition means more depth"

## Key Innovation: The "Vertical Team" Model

**Unlike traditional grade-level PLCs:**
- Cross-grade perspective
- Focus on curriculum coherence
- Long-term student learning trajectory

**Working WITH grade-level PLCs:**
- Vertical team designed sequence
- Grade-level teams implemented with their own CFAs
- Both types of collaboration valuable

---

## Lessons Learned

**What worked:**
- Having one teacher per grade (not whole faculty)
- Clear focus on specific problem (STEM alignment)
- Time-limited initially (one year pilot)

**Challenge:**
- Scheduling cross-grade meetings when everyone free

**Recommendation:**
Other schools could use vertical teams for any area needing K-12 alignment (writing, reading, math progressions, etc.)

## Sustainability

**2024-2025:** Continuing cross-grade STEM PLC, adding vertical team for literacy progression
