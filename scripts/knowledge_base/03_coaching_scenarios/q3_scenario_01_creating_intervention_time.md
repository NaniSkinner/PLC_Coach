# Coaching Scenario: Creating Time for Intervention Without Pulling from Core

## Context

Principal Karen leads an elementary school that has identified students needing intervention based on CFA data, but teachers say "we don't have time" for intervention. Currently, students are pulled from core instruction (math, reading) for intervention, meaning they miss new content while getting remediation on old content. Karen knows this isn't working but doesn't know how to restructure the schedule.

**School:** K-5 elementary, 450 students, suburban

**Current Reality:** Students pulled from core classes for intervention → miss grade-level instruction → fall further behind

**Challenge:** Create intervention time embedded in school day without removing students from core instruction

## The Coaching Conversation

### Turn 1: Principal Opens

**Karen:** I feel stuck. Our teachers are doing CFAs, identifying students who need intervention, and genuinely want to help them. But when I ask "when will you provide intervention?" they say "we don't have time."

Currently what happens is kids get pulled from their regular math class to work with the intervention specialist on last month's skills. So they're getting remediation but missing today's grade-level lesson. They never catch up - they're always behind.

I know this is wrong, but I don't know how to fix it. Our schedule is packed. Where do we find 30 minutes a day for intervention without taking it from something else?

**Coach Response:**

Karen, you've diagnosed the problem perfectly. "Rob from Peter to pay Paul" intervention doesn't work - students can't catch up if they're missing new content. The good news is you don't need to add time to the school day. You need to reorganize existing time.

Let me ask: What does your daily schedule look like? When do all students have specials (PE, art, music)? And when are specialists like your intervention teacher, counselor, or instructional coaches working with students?

### Turn 2-8: [Conversation continues with coach helping Karen explore:]

**Model 1: Grade-Level Intervention Blocks**
- 30-minute block daily where ONE grade level has intervention/extension while others have specials
- Example: Monday 1:30-2:00 = 3rd grade intervention block, other grades have specials
- All 3rd grade teachers, specialists, principal participate
- Students not needing intervention receive extension

**Model 2: School-Wide Intervention Time**
- 30-minute block daily where WHOLE SCHOOL does intervention/extension simultaneously
- Every adult in building (principal, counselor, specialists, teachers) leads a group
- Students assigned to groups based on need
- Groups change every 3-4 weeks based on new data

**Model 3: Flex Time Within Core Blocks**
- 90-minute literacy block structured: 60 min whole class + 30 min small group
- While teacher works with intervention group, proficient students do extension independently
- Rotate groups so all students receive direct instruction

**For Karen's Context:**
- 450 students, ~75 per grade level
- Has specialists (PE, Art, Music) serving 1-2 grades at a time
- Has intervention specialist, counselor, instructional coach

**Coach Recommendation:** Model 1 (Grade-Level Intervention Blocks)
- Monday: K intervention block
- Tuesday: 1st grade intervention block
- Wednesday: 2nd grade intervention block
- Thursday: 3rd grade intervention block
- Friday: 4th/5th grade intervention block

Each grade gets 30 minutes of intensive intervention weekly, plus teachers provide additional intervention during core instruction using Model 3.

**Logistics to Address:**
- Special schedules must rotate to accommodate intervention blocks
- All adults (specials teachers, support staff) participate during their grade's block
- Students pre-assigned to groups based on CFA data
- Groups are fluid - change based on ongoing assessment

**Principal's Concern:** "What about students needing intervention more than once per week?"

**Coach's Response:** "The 30-minute intervention block is Tier 2 - small group, targeted. Students needing more intensive support (Tier 3) might receive additional intervention during core blocks using Model 3, or before/after school for the most at-risk students. But the embedded block ensures EVERY struggling student gets at least one guaranteed intervention session weekly."

**Outcome:** Karen commits to piloting Model 1 with one grade level (3rd grade) for 6 weeks. If successful, scale to whole school. She'll present plan to staff next week, emphasizing that this is about organizing existing time differently, not adding to teacher workload.

## Coaching Analysis

### Key Coaching Moves
- Validated that current model (pulling from core) doesn't work
- Provided three concrete scheduling models, not vague "you need to find time"
- Helped principal match model to her school's context
- Addressed logistical concerns and staff resistance proactively
- Suggested pilot approach to reduce risk

### PLC Concepts
- Systematic intervention requires structural changes, not just good intentions
- Intervention should supplement, not replace, core instruction
- All educators participate in intervention (not just specialists)
- Intervention time must be embedded in school day for equity

### Implementation Challenges
1. Special teachers may resist changing schedules
2. Teachers unfamiliar with leading intervention groups
3. Logistics of grouping students and tracking progress
4. Sustainability when novelty wears off

### Likely Outcomes
- Pilot will reveal implementation challenges
- Students will receive intervention without missing core instruction
- Teachers will need training on intervention strategies
- Model will need refinement after pilot

## Reflection Questions
1. Why doesn't pulling students from core instruction for intervention work?
2. What are advantages/disadvantages of each scheduling model?
3. How can principals address staff resistance to schedule changes?
