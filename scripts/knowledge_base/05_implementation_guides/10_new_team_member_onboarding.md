# New Team Member Onboarding Guide

## Purpose
This guide helps teams quickly integrate new members (new hires, transfers, or long-term substitutes) into existing PLC structures.

---

## Week 1: Welcome & Context

**Team Leader Tasks:**
- [ ] Schedule 30-minute one-on-one welcome meeting
- [ ] Provide copies of team norms, essential standards, and meeting schedule
- [ ] Share access to team's shared drive/folder
- [ ] Add to team email distribution list

**Topics to Cover in Welcome Meeting:**
1. Team norms - how we work together
2. Meeting schedule (day, time, location)
3. Current focus/goals
4. Who does what (roles on the team)
5. Questions new member has

**Provide New Member:**
- Team norms document
- List of essential standards for grade/course
- Calendar of upcoming meetings and assessments
- Access credentials for shared resources

---

## Week 2-3: PLC Foundations

**Essential Knowledge New Member Needs:**

### Our Essential Standards
- Which standards we've identified as essential
- Why these were selected (endurance, leverage, readiness)
- How essential standards are different from supporting standards

**Team Leader:** Schedule 45 minutes to review essential standards document together

### Our Assessment System
- CFA schedule for year
- How we develop CFAs collaboratively
- How we score assessments (rubrics, calibration)
- Data analysis meeting process

**Action:** Invite new member to observe (not lead) next data analysis meeting

### Our Intervention Structures
- How we identify students needing intervention
- When/where intervention happens
- Who provides intervention
- How we monitor progress

**Action:** Share intervention schedules and current intervention student lists

### Our Extension Practices
- How we provide extension for proficient students
- Extension vs. enrichment distinction
- Current extension tasks/menus

---

## Month 1: Participation & Integration

### Calibration Activities

**Critical for consistent scoring:**
- [ ] New member scores 5-6 anchor papers
- [ ] Team discusses scoring together
- [ ] Calibrate understanding of proficiency

**Why This Matters:** Ensures new member scores assessments consistently with team

### First CFA Cycle

**New member participates in:**
- Administering CFA (same timing as rest of team)
- Scoring using team rubric
- Data analysis meeting
- Re-teaching/intervention planning

**Team Leader:** Check in after first CFA cycle - "How did that go? Questions?"

### Norm-Building

**Help new member understand team culture:**
- Model norms in action during meetings
- Explain why certain norms exist
- Give grace as new member learns team expectations

**If new member violates norm:** Gentle private conversation explaining team agreement

---

## Month 2-3: Full Integration

### Rotating Roles

**Gradually increase responsibility:**
- Week 4-5: Norms monitor or timekeeper (lower-stakes roles)
- Week 6-8: Recorder
- Week 9+: Occasional facilitator (with support)

**Don't expect:** New member to lead team immediately

### Contributing Ideas

**Encourage new member to:**
- Share strategies from previous school/experience
- Ask "why do we do it this way?" questions
- Suggest improvements based on fresh perspective

**Team mindset:** New members bring valuable outside perspective - don't dismiss ideas just because "we've always done it differently"

### Building Relationships

**Beyond Work:**
- Invite to lunch
- Include in informal team interactions
- Share classroom visits/observations

**Trust takes time:** Don't expect immediate deep collaboration

---

## Ongoing: Support & Feedback

### Monthly Check-Ins (First Semester)

**Team leader asks:**
1. How are you feeling about team collaboration?
2. What's working well for you?
3. What's confusing or unclear?
4. What support would be helpful?
5. Any concerns about team dynamics?

### Mid-Year Reflection

**After 3-4 months, discuss:**
- Does new member feel fully integrated?
- Any lingering questions about PLC processes?
- How can team continue to support?

---

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: New Member Overwhelmed

**Signs:** Quiet in meetings, not contributing, seems confused

**Solution:**
- Acknowledge it's a lot to learn
- Pair with "buddy" team member for questions
- Provide written reference materials
- Check in frequently

### Challenge 2: New Member Resistant to Team Norms/Practices

**Signs:** "At my old school we did it differently," pushback on agreements

**Solution:**
- Explain rationale for team decisions
- Invite questions and discussion
- Be open to improving practices
- Clear expectation: participate in team agreements even while learning

### Challenge 3: New Member from Non-PLC School

**Signs:** Doesn't understand CFAs, collaborative culture, intervention systems

**Solution:**
- Provide PLC foundations reading/video
- Explain "why" behind practices, not just "what"
- More explicit teaching of PLC processes
- Connect to instructional coach for additional support

### Challenge 4: Team Assumes New Member "Gets It"

**Signs:** No onboarding process, new member left to figure things out

**Solution:**
- Use this guide systematically
- Designate team member as onboarding liaison
- Provide explicit instruction, don't assume understanding
