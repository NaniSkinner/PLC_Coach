# Essential Standards Selection Guide

## Quick Reference: The Three Filters

Use these three filters to determine if a standard is "essential":

**ENDURANCE:** Will students need this beyond a single test?
**LEVERAGE:** Does this help in other areas of learning?
**READINESS:** Is this critical for success at the next level?

If a standard passes all three filters strongly → Essential Standard
If a standard passes 1-2 filters weakly → Supporting Standard

## Selection Process (90-minute team meeting)

**Step 1: Individual Review** (15 min)
Each teacher reviews all standards for grade/course and identifies personal top 10-15 essentials using three filters.

**Step 2: Share & Identify Consensus** (20 min)
Team shares lists, marks standards appearing on all/most lists as "clear essentials."

**Step 3: Discuss Disagreements** (30 min)
For standards where team disagrees, teacher advocating for inclusion makes case using three filters.

**Step 4: Finalize List** (20 min)
If more than 15, ask: "If we could guarantee mastery of only 12, which 12 would have biggest impact?"

**Step 5: Document Rationale** (5 min)
Record WHY each essential was selected (protects decisions if questioned).

## Sample Completed Selection

**Grade 4 Math Essential Standards** (12 selected from 38 total)

| Essential Standard | Endurance | Leverage | Readiness |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Multi-digit multiplication | High | High | High |
| Fraction concepts & equivalence | High | High | High |
| Multi-digit division | High | Medium | High |
| Decimal place value | High | High | High |
| Adding/subtracting fractions | High | Medium | High |
| Area & perimeter | Medium | Medium | High |

**Supporting Standards** (taught but not with same depth/intervention):
- Angle measurement, data interpretation, etc.

## Common Questions

**Q: Don't all standards matter?**
A: Yes, you teach all standards. Essential standards get more time, deeper instruction, common assessments, and systematic intervention. Supporting standards get less emphasis.

**Q: What if we're wrong?**
A: Essentials aren't permanent. Revisit annually based on data and experience.

**Q: How many essentials is right?**
A: Typically 10-15 per content area per year. More than 20 = trying to make everything essential (defeats purpose).

## Next Steps After Selection

- [ ] Unpack each essential standard (define proficiency)
- [ ] Develop common formative assessments
- [ ] Plan intervention structures
- [ ] Communicate essentials to students/parents
- [ ] Revisit list at end of year based on results
