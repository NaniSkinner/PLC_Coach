# Coaching Scenario: Making Intervention Directive, Not Optional

## Context

High school English teacher Patricia has identified 12 students needing intervention on argument writing based on CFA data. She's offering lunchtime intervention sessions, but only 3-4 students show up consistently. The rest say they're "too busy" or "don't need help." Patricia is frustrated - she has the data, she's offering support, but students won't come. She needs guidance on making intervention directive.

**Context:** 12 students identified for intervention, only 3-4 attending optional lunchtime sessions

**Challenge:** How to make intervention required when students resist

## The Coaching Conversation

### Turn 1: Teacher Opens

**Patricia:** I'm so frustrated. I identified 12 students who failed our argument writing CFA - they scored below 60% when proficiency is 75%. I offered lunchtime intervention three days a week. I even provide snacks! But most of them don't come. They say "I'm fine" or "I have other stuff to do." Meanwhile they're failing, and I'm here ready to help them. How do I get students to attend intervention when they don't want to?

**Coach Response:**

Patricia, let me reframe this. The question isn't "how do I get students to attend?" It's "why is intervention optional in the first place?" Let me ask you: If a student failed a math test, would they be allowed to skip the next math class because they "have other stuff to do"? No. So why is intervention - which is essentially additional instruction on essential content they haven't mastered - optional?

### Turns 2-8: [Conversation continues covering:]

**Shift from Optional to Directive:**

**Current Model (Doesn't Work):**
- Teacher: "I'm offering help at lunch if you want to come"
- Student: "No thanks, I'm good"
- Result: Students continue failing

**Directive Model:**
- School: "Data shows you haven't mastered essential writing skills. You're assigned to intervention Tuesday/Thursday during advisory period"
- Student: "I don't want to go"
- School: "This isn't optional - it's required support based on your assessment results"

**Key Mindset Shifts:**

**From:** Intervention is a favor we offer
**To:** Intervention is systematic school response to learning need

**From:** Students choose whether to get extra help
**To:** Schools ensure all students master essential standards

**From:** Intervention is punishment for failure
**To:** Intervention is additional time and support for learning

**Practical Structures for Directive Intervention:**

**1. Embed in School Day**
- Advisory period, study hall, or dedicated intervention block
- Not before/after school or lunch (too easy to skip)
- Built into schedule like any other class

**2. Data-Driven Assignment**
- CFA scores automatically trigger intervention placement
- Not teacher recommendation or student choice
- Clear criteria: Below 75% on CFA = intervention assignment

**3. Clear Communication**
- Letters home: "Your student has been assigned to intervention based on assessment data"
- Not asking permission, informing of support
- Parents informed but consent not required

**4. Consequences for Non-Attendance**
- Treat like any class absence
- Follow up: "You missed intervention Tuesday. We'll need to reschedule."
- Not punitive, but persistent

**5. Exit Criteria**
- Students exit when they demonstrate proficiency
- Re-assess after 2-3 weeks
- Motivation: "Show mastery and you can exit intervention"

**Addressing Patricia's Context:**

**Immediate:** Patricia can't change school systems alone - needs admin support

**Steps:**
1. Share data with department head/admin: "12 students failing argument writing, only 3 attending voluntary intervention"
2. Propose directive model: "Could we assign these students to intervention during advisory period?"
3. Get admin buy-in for required attendance and consequences
4. Communicate to students: "Based on CFA scores, you're assigned to writing intervention Tuesdays/Thursdays 2:00-2:30. You can exit when you demonstrate 75% proficiency on reassessment."

**Addressing Student Resistance:**

**Student: "But I don't need intervention, I'm fine!"**
**Teacher: "The data shows you scored 55% when proficiency is 75%. Once you demonstrate mastery, you can exit."**

**Student: "This isn't fair, other kids don't have to go!"**
**Teacher: "Other students already demonstrated proficiency. This is about everyone mastering essential skills, just with different amounts of time and support."**

**Student: "I have better things to do."**
**Teacher: "Writing skills are essential for graduation and college. This is non-negotiable support to help you succeed."**

**Outcome:** Patricia will present proposal to her principal for directive intervention during advisory period. She realizes she can't solve this alone - it requires systemic structures. Principal agrees to pilot with English department, assigning intervention based on CFA data with required attendance.

## Coaching Analysis

### Key Coaching Moves
- Reframed intervention from "optional favor" to "systematic required support"
- Addressed that individual teachers can't implement directive intervention alone - requires admin/systems
- Provided specific language for responding to student resistance
- Connected directive intervention to essential standards and high expectations

### PLC Concepts
- Intervention must be directive (required) to be effective
- All students must master essential standards - intervention ensures this
- Time as variable: Some students need more time, but learning outcome is constant
- Systemic structures needed: Can't rely on individual teacher heroics

### Likely Outcomes
- School will implement directive intervention pilot
- Attendance will increase significantly (from 25% to 85%+)
- Student achievement will improve when they receive required support
- Some students/parents will initially resist but compliance will normalize

### Challenges
- Building-level buy-in required (not just individual teacher)
- Requires schedule changes and systematic structures
- Initial resistance from students who don't see need
- Need clear communication to parents about required support

## Reflection Questions
1. Why doesn't optional/voluntary intervention work at secondary level?
2. How is directive intervention different from punishment?
3. What systems must be in place for directive intervention to work?
