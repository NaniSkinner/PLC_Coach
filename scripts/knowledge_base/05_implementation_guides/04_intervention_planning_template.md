## EXAMPLES OF COMPLETED PLANS

### Example 1: Reading Comprehension Intervention

**Students:** Marcus, Sofia, James (Grade 3)
**Standard:** Determine main idea and supporting details

**Diagnostic Data:**
- CFA Score: 45-55% (proficiency = 75%)
- Error pattern: Students identify details but struggle connecting them to main idea
- Prerequisite check: Can decode text fluently

**Intervention Design:**
- Group: 3 students
- Frequency: 4x/week, 25 minutes
- Duration: 6 weeks
- Provider: Reading specialist
- Time: 1:30-1:55pm during intervention block

**Instructional Approach:**
- Explicit teaching of "umbrella strategy" for main idea
- Teacher think-alouds modeling how to determine main idea
- Graphic organizers connecting details to main idea
- Gradually release to independent practice

**Progress Monitoring:** Weekly 5-paragraph passages with main idea questions

**Decision Rule:** Need 80%+ on 2 consecutive weekly checks to exit

### Example 2: Multi-Step Word Problems Intervention

**Students:** 5 students (Grade 4)
**Standard:** Solve multi-step word problems using four operations

**Diagnostic Data:**
- CFA Score: 30-50% (proficiency = 75%)
- Error pattern: Students attempt one operation but don't see problems require multiple steps
- Prerequisite check: Can perform single-step operations accurately

**Intervention Design:**
- Group: 5 students
- Frequency: 4x/week, 30 minutes
- Duration: 8 weeks
- Provider: Classroom teacher (Mrs. Johnson)
- Time: 10:00-10:30am (while proficient students do extension)

**Instructional Approach:**
- Explicit teaching of "question analysis" protocol
- Color-code word problems to identify steps
- Checklist scaffold that fades over time
- Worked examples with teacher think-aloud
- Immediate feedback on student attempts

**Progress Monitoring:** 5-problem probe every 2 weeks

**Decision Rule:** Need 75%+ proficiency on 2 consecutive probes to exit

## APPENDIX: COMMON INTERVENTION MISTAKES TO AVOID

**Mistake 1: Vague Target**
❌ "Help with math"
✅ "Multiply multi-digit numbers using standard algorithm"

**Mistake 2: Not Different from Core**
❌ "More practice worksheets"
✅ "Explicit modeling with worked examples, scaffolds, immediate feedback"

**Mistake 3: Too Infrequent**
❌ Once per week
✅ 3-4 times per week minimum

**Mistake 4: No Progress Monitoring**
❌ Wait until next CFA to check progress
✅ Brief checks every 1-2 weeks

**Mistake 5: Continue Indefinitely**
❌ Student in intervention all year without change
✅ Decision point at 6-8 weeks: continue, intensify, or exit

**Remember:** Well-planned intervention is the difference between students who catch up and students who fall further behind. Invest time in planning to ensure intervention is truly systematic and effective.
