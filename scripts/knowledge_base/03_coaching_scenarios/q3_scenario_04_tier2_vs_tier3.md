# Coaching Scenario: Distinguishing Tier 2 and Tier 3 Interventions

## Context

Second-grade teacher Amy has three students who have been in Tier 2 reading intervention for 12 weeks with minimal progress. They're still reading at mid-first grade level when they should be mid-second grade. Amy keeps providing the same small-group intervention, but nothing's changing. She's unsure whether to continue Tier 2, move them to Tier 3, or refer them for special education evaluation.

**Context:** 3 students, 12 weeks Tier 2, minimal progress, still significantly below grade level

**Challenge:** When to intensify from Tier 2 to Tier 3, and how Tier 3 differs from Tier 2

## The Coaching Conversation

### Turn 1: Teacher Opens

**Amy:** I have three students who have been in my Tier 2 reading intervention group since September - it's now December. They've made tiny progress, maybe moved up half a level, but they're still reading at mid-first grade when they should be mid-second grade. I'm meeting with them 25 minutes a day, four days a week, in groups of 5-6 students. I don't know what else to do. Do I just keep going? Should they be in special education?

**Coach Response:**

Amy, let me ask you directly: If what you're doing hasn't worked after 12 weeks, why would continuing the same thing work for the next 12 weeks? You've got three students who are not responding to Tier 2 intervention. That tells you they need more intensive support - Tier 3. Let me show you how Tier 3 differs from Tier 2 and when students need to move up.

### Turns 2-8: [Conversation continues with coach explaining:]

**Tier 2 vs. Tier 3 Characteristics:**

| Aspect | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Group Size | 4-6 students | 1-3 students |
| Frequency | 3-4x per week | 4-5x per week (daily) |
| Duration | 20-30 min | 30-45 min |
| Who Provides | Classroom teacher or specialist | Reading specialist or special education teacher |
| Instruction | Targeted to skill gap | Highly explicit, systematic, foundational |
| Progress Monitoring | Every 2 weeks | Weekly |
| Duration of Intervention | 6-10 weeks | 12+ weeks, may be ongoing |

**Decision Rule: When to Move from Tier 2 to Tier 3**

**Tier 2 → Tier 3 Criteria:**
- Student has received quality Tier 2 intervention for 6-8 weeks
- Progress monitoring shows inadequate growth (less than expected rate)
- Student is significantly below grade level (1.5+ years behind)
- Gap is widening despite intervention

**For Amy's Three Students:**
- ✓ Received Tier 2 for 12 weeks (sufficient time)
- ✓ Minimal progress (inadequate growth)
- ✓ Full year behind (mid-1st vs. mid-2nd grade level)
- Decision: Move to Tier 3

**What Changes in Tier 3:**

**1. Smaller Group Size**
- Amy's current group: 5-6 students
- Tier 3 group: 1-3 students max
- Allows for more individualized instruction and immediate feedback

**2. More Frequent, Longer Sessions**
- Current: 25 min, 4x/week = 100 min/week
- Tier 3: 40 min, 5x/week = 200 min/week
- Doubled instructional time

**3. Different Instructional Approach**
- Tier 2 focuses on grade-level skills students missed
- Tier 3 goes back to foundational skills (phonemic awareness, phonics basics)
- More explicit, systematic, with more repetition and practice

**4. Different Instructor**
- Tier 2: Classroom teacher
- Tier 3: Reading specialist or special education teacher
- Need expertise in intensive reading intervention

**5. More Frequent Progress Monitoring**
- Tier 2: Every 2 weeks
- Tier 3: Weekly
- Allows faster detection if approach isn't working

**Special Education Referral Question:**

**Coach Clarifies:** Tier 3 is NOT special education. It's general education intensive intervention. Students can receive Tier 3 without IEPs.

**When to Refer for Special Education Evaluation:**
- Student has received quality Tier 3 intervention for 12+ weeks
- Despite intensive intervention, student shows little/no progress
- Gap continues to widen
- At this point, evaluate for learning disability

**Sequence:**
1. Tier 2 (6-10 weeks) - didn't work
2. Tier 3 (12-16 weeks) - if doesn't work
3. Special education evaluation

**For Amy's Students:**
- Currently in Week 12 of Tier 2
- Next step: Move to Tier 3 (NOT special ed referral yet)
- Give Tier 3 another 12 weeks
- If still minimal progress after Tier 3, THEN consider special ed evaluation

**Practical Implementation:**

**Amy's Action Steps:**
1. Meet with reading specialist/intervention team
2. Present progress monitoring data showing lack of response to Tier 2
3. Request Tier 3 placement for these 3 students
4. Reading specialist takes over intervention (Amy may not have expertise for Tier 3)
5. Weekly progress monitoring begins
6. Revisit in 6-8 weeks to assess response

**Outcome:** Amy understands her three students need MORE intensive intervention (Tier 3), not the same intervention longer. She'll present data to intervention team requesting Tier 3 placement. She realizes Tier 3 likely requires reading specialist, not just herself with smaller group.

## Coaching Analysis

### Key Coaching Moves
- Challenged assumption that "keep doing the same thing" will produce different results
- Provided clear comparison chart showing Tier 2 vs. Tier 3 differences
- Explained decision rules for moving between tiers
- Clarified that Tier 3 ≠ special education (common misconception)
- Gave practical implementation steps

### PLC Concepts
- Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS) with clear criteria for each tier
- Intervention intensity increases based on student response (or lack thereof)
- Progress monitoring data drives tier movement decisions
- Tier 3 is general education intervention, not special education
- Special education referral only after documented lack of response to intensive intervention

### Likely Outcomes
- Amy's three students will move to Tier 3
- With more intensive support, at least 2 of 3 will likely show accelerated progress
- One student may ultimately need special education evaluation if still not responsive
- Amy will understand tiered intervention framework better for future students

### Common Misconceptions Addressed
1. "Tier 3 = special education" (No - Tier 3 is general ed intensive support)
2. "Keep trying Tier 2 longer" (No - non-responders need different intensity, not more time in same tier)
3. "All struggling readers go straight to special ed" (No - must document intervention attempts first)
4. "Teacher can provide all tiers" (No - Tier 3 typically requires specialist expertise)

## Reflection Questions
1. How does Tier 3 differ from Tier 2 in intensity and approach?
2. What data indicates a student is not responding to current tier of intervention?
3. Why must schools provide intensive intervention before special education referral?
