# Coaching Scenario: Selecting Effective Intervention Strategies

## Context

Middle school math teacher Carlos has 7 students in intervention for solving equations with variables on both sides. He's been giving them extra practice worksheets during intervention time, but they're still making the same errors. Carlos realizes "more practice" isn't intervention - he needs different instructional strategies. He needs guidance on what effective intervention instruction actually looks like.

**Context:** 7 students struggling with equations, current "intervention" is just more practice

**Challenge:** What instructional strategies make intervention different from (and more effective than) core instruction?

## The Coaching Conversation

### Turn 1: Teacher Opens

**Carlos:** I have seven 8th graders who failed our CFA on solving equations with variables on both sides. During core instruction, I taught the concept, we did examples together, they practiced independently. In intervention, I'm giving them similar practice problems to work on. But they're making the exact same mistakes. I'm realizing that just giving them more practice isn't really "intervention." What should I actually be DOING differently during intervention time?

**Coach Response:**

Carlos, you've had an important realization. Intervention isn't "more of the same" - it's "different and more intensive." If students didn't learn with your core instruction approach, repeating that approach won't work. Let me show you what research says makes intervention effective: explicit instruction with scaffolding. Here's what that looks like...

### Turns 2-8: [Conversation continues with coach explaining:]

**Why "More Practice" Doesn't Work:**

Students making the same errors repeatedly are practicing errors, not mastering skills. Practice is only helpful AFTER students understand the process. Your intervention students don't understand yet, so practice isn't helpful.

**Effective Intervention Strategies:**

**1. Explicit Instruction (Not Discovery)**

**Core Instruction:** "Here's a problem: 3x + 5 = 2x + 9. How might you solve it? Turn and talk about strategies..."

**Intervention:** "When we have variables on both sides, we need to get all variables on one side. Here's how: First, subtract 2x from both sides. Watch me do it. [Models step by step.] Now you try this one with me..."

**Why It Works:** Struggling students need direct, clear explanation of WHAT to do and WHY, not exploration.

**2. Worked Examples with Think-Alouds**

**Coach Models:**
"I'm going to solve 5x - 3 = 3x + 7 and tell you exactly what I'm thinking at each step:
- FIRST, I ask myself: Where are the variables? On both sides.
- SO, I need to get variables together on one side. I'll subtract 3x from both sides.
- NOW I have: 2x - 3 = 7
- NEXT, I need to isolate the variable. I'll add 3 to both sides.
- SO: 2x = 10
- FINALLY: x = 5"

**Why It Works:** Making thinking visible helps students understand the decision-making process, not just memorize steps.

**3. Gradual Release with Immediate Feedback**

**Sequence:**
- **I Do**: Teacher models, thinking aloud (2 problems)
- **We Do**: Teacher and students solve together, students explain each step (3 problems)
- **You Do With Me Watching**: Students solve independently while teacher watches and gives immediate feedback (3 problems)
- **You Do**: Independent practice only AFTER demonstrated understanding

**Why It Works:** Catches errors immediately before they become habits.

**4. Identifying and Addressing Misconceptions**

**Carlos's Students' Specific Errors:**

**Error Type 1:** Student writes "3x + 5 = 2x + 9" then does "3x + 2x = 9 + 5" (incorrectly moves terms without subtracting)

**Misconception:** Thinking you can just "move" terms to the other side without operating on both sides

**Intervention:** Explicitly teach that equation is a balance - whatever you do to one side must be done to other side. Use visual balance scale model.

**Error Type 2:** Student writes "3x - 2x + 5 = 9" then "1x + 5 = 9" then "x = 4" (correct process) but then "checks" by plugging back in wrong

**Misconception:** Doesn't understand how to verify solution

**Intervention:** Explicitly teach checking process as separate skill

**5. Scaffolding That Fades**

**Initial Scaffold (Week 1-2):**
Give students a step-by-step checklist:
□ Step 1: Get variables on one side (subtract smaller variable term)
□ Step 2: Combine variable terms
□ Step 3: Get constants on other side (add/subtract)
□ Step 4: Divide to isolate variable
□ Step 5: Check solution

**Fading Scaffold (Week 3-4):**
Students use checklist but write fewer notes
Eventually, internalize process

**Why It Works:** Scaffolds provide support while learning, then gradually remove support as competence develops.

**6. Cumulative Review**

**Core Instruction:** Moves to new content when unit ends

**Intervention:** Spirals back to previous content
- Day 1: Equations with variables both sides
- Day 2: Equations with variables both sides + review previous skill (distributive property)
- Day 3: Equations with variables both sides + review earlier skill (one-step equations)

**Why It Works:** Struggling students need more repetition and connection to previously learned skills.

**What Carlos's Intervention Should Look Like:**

**Day 1: Explicit Modeling**
- 10 min: Model solving 3 problems with think-aloud
- 10 min: "We do" - students guide teacher through solving, explaining each step
- 5 min: Students try one problem independently, Carlos circulates providing immediate feedback

**Day 2: Guided Practice**
- 5 min: Review yesterday's process using checklist
- 15 min: Students solve problems with Carlos watching closely, correcting errors immediately
- 5 min: Students explain to each other why each step works

**Day 3: Addressing Misconceptions**
- 10 min: Show common errors (like the ones his students make), explicitly teach why they're wrong
- 10 min: Practice with checklist support
- 5 min: Quick check to assess understanding

**Key Differences from Core Instruction:**
- More explicit (direct teaching vs. exploration)
- More modeling (3 worked examples vs. 1)
- More guided practice (20 min vs. 5 min)
- More immediate feedback (constant circulating vs. periodic)
- Smaller steps (break process into sub-skills)
- More scaffolds (checklist, visual models)

**Outcome:** Carlos realizes his intervention has been "more practice" not "different instruction." He commits to using explicit instruction with worked examples, addressing his students' specific misconceptions, and providing scaffolded support. He'll model extensively before asking for independent practice.

## Coaching Analysis

### Key Coaching Moves
- Explained why "more practice" doesn't work for struggling students
- Provided concrete intervention strategies grounded in research
- Used Carlos's actual student errors to illustrate how to address misconceptions
- Showed what intervention lessons should look like day-by-day
- Contrasted intervention approach with core instruction approach

### PLC Concepts
- Intervention requires different (more explicit, scaffolded) instruction, not just more time
- Effective intervention addresses specific misconceptions revealed by CFA data
- Gradual release model appropriate for intervention
- Scaffolds provide temporary support that fades as competence grows
- Immediate feedback prevents students from practicing errors

### Likely Outcomes
- Carlos's intervention will be more effective (students will show progress)
- Students will receive explicit instruction they need to master equations
- Misconceptions will be directly addressed rather than perpetuated
- Carlos will develop intervention teaching skills transferable to other content

### Common Misconceptions Addressed
1. "Intervention = more practice" (No - intervention = different instruction)
2. "Struggling students learn same way as proficient students" (No - need more explicit teaching)
3. "Discovery learning works for all students" (No - struggling students need direct instruction)
4. "Practice makes perfect" (No - practice makes permanent, whether correct or incorrect)

## Reflection Questions
1. How does effective intervention instruction differ from core instruction?
2. Why doesn't "more practice" work for struggling students?
3. What role do scaffolds play in intervention, and why must they fade?
