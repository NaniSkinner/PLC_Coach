# Common Formative Assessment Design Checklist

## Pre-Design: Foundation

- [ ] Essential standards for this unit have been identified
- [ ] Standards have been unpacked (proficiency criteria defined)
- [ ] Team has agreed on what proficiency looks like
- [ ] Timeline for administration determined (leaves time for intervention)

## Alignment

- [ ] Every item traces directly to an essential standard
- [ ] Items match the cognitive demand of the standards
- [ ] No items assess nice-to-know content not in essentials
- [ ] Assessment format matches what standard requires (e.g., if standard says "analyze," items require analysis not recall)

## Item Quality

- [ ] Mix of item types (selected response + constructed response)
- [ ] Clear, grade-appropriate language
- [ ] No trick questions or unnecessarily confusing wording
- [ ] Answer key/rubric developed before administration
- [ ] Team agrees on scoring for each item

## Length & Timing

- [ ] Appropriate length for grade level (10-15 min elementary, 20-30 min secondary)
- [ ] Focuses on 3-5 essential standards (not trying to assess everything)
- [ ] Balances thoroughness with efficiency

## Logistics

- [ ] Administration date agreed upon (all teachers same week)
- [ ] Conditions standardized (time allowed, resources permitted)
- [ ] Scoring approach determined (who scores, when, how)
- [ ] Data analysis meeting scheduled
- [ ] Data entry/compilation plan exists

## Post-Administration Planning

- [ ] Team knows when/how they'll analyze results together
- [ ] Protocol for data analysis selected
- [ ] Time allocated for re-teaching based on results
- [ ] Intervention structures ready for students who don't reach proficiency

## Quality Check Questions

**Before administering CFA, ask:**
1. If a student scores proficient on this assessment, are we confident they've mastered the essential standard?
2. Can we tell from results what specific skills students have/haven't mastered?
3. Will results inform our instruction in time to help students?
4. Are we prepared to respond if many students don't reach proficiency?

**If "no" to any question, revise CFA before administering.**
