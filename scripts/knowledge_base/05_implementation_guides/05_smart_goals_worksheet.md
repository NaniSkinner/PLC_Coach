# SMART Goals Development Worksheet

## Purpose

This worksheet guides teams through developing Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Results-oriented, and Time-bound (SMART) goals that focus collaborative work on improving student learning outcomes.

---

## SMART GOAL CRITERIA

**S = SPECIFIC**
Clearly identifies WHAT will improve and for WHOM

**M = MEASURABLE**
Includes objective data showing whether achievement occurred

**A = ACHIEVABLE**
Ambitious yet attainable with focused effort

**R = RESULTS-ORIENTED**
Focuses on student learning outcomes, not adult activities

**T = TIME-BOUND**
Includes specific deadline for achievement

---

## STEP 1: ANALYZE CURRENT REALITY

### Review Data Sources

**What data sources inform our goal?**
- [ ] Recent CFA results
- [ ] Benchmark assessments
- [ ] State test data
- [ ] Universal screening
- [ ] Previous year's performance
- [ ] Other: _______________________________________________

### Identify Current Performance

**Content area/Standard:** ____________________________________

**Current performance baseline:**
- % of students proficient: __________%

## STEP 3: DRAFT SMART GOAL

### Goal Formula Template

"By **[DATE]**, **[STUDENT GROUP]** will **[ACHIEVE WHAT RESULT]**, as measured by **[SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT]**, improving from **[BASELINE]** to **[TARGET]**."

### Draft Your Goal

**By** (date): _______________________________________________

**(student group)**: __________________________________________
(Examples: "all 3rd grade students," "8th grade students receiving Tier 2 intervention," "students in Algebra 1")

**will** (achieve what result): __________________________________
(Examples: "demonstrate proficiency in multiplying fractions," "write cohesive argumentative essays," "solve quadratic equations using multiple methods")

**as measured by** (specific assessment): _______________________
(Examples: "common formative assessments," "district benchmark," "rubric-scored writing samples")

**improving from** (baseline): ________% to (target): ________%

### Complete Goal Statement

Write your complete SMART goal:

_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

## STEP 4: TEST AGAINST SMART CRITERIA

### Is Your Goal SPECIFIC?

Does it clearly identify:
- [ ] Exactly what content/skill will improve?
- [ ] For which specific group of students?
- [ ] What aspect of achievement you're targeting?

**If NO to any:** Revise to add specificity: ____________________
_____________________________________________________________

### Is Your Goal MEASURABLE?

- [ ] Have you identified the specific assessment tool?
- [ ] Will this tool provide objective data?
- [ ] Can you track progress over time?
- [ ] Is proficiency clearly defined?

**If NO to any:** Revise measurement approach: __________________
_____________________________________________________________

### Is Your Goal ACHIEVABLE?

**Consider:**
- Starting point: _________% proficient currently
- Target: _________% proficient
- Growth needed: _________percentage points
- Time available: _________ weeks/months
- Typical growth rate: _________ points per month

**Is this realistic but challenging?**
- [ ] Too easy (will achieve with normal instruction)
- [ ] Just right (requires focused effort but doable)
- [ ] Too hard (unrealistic given time/resources)

**If not "just right":** Revise target: __________________________
_____________________________________________________________

### Is Your Goal RESULTS-ORIENTED?

**Does your goal focus on:**
- [ ] Student learning outcomes (YES - keep it)
- [ ] Adult activities (NO - revise)

**Common mistakes:**
❌ "We will implement guided reading" (activity, not result)
❌ "Teachers will use formative assessment" (activity, not result)
❌ "We will meet weekly as PLC" (activity, not result)

**If goal describes activity:** Revise to focus on student learning:
_____________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________

### Is Your Goal TIME-BOUND?

- [ ] Specific deadline included?
- [ ] Deadline allows enough time for instruction?
- [ ] Deadline leaves time for intervention before unit ends?
- [ ] Aligns with assessment schedule?

**If missing clear timeline:** Add deadline: _____________________

## STEP 5: IDENTIFY STRATEGIES

**Achieving goals requires action. What will we DO to reach this goal?**

### Instructional Strategies

**What instructional approaches will we use?**
- _____________________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________________

**How will instruction differ from past approaches?**
_____________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________

### Assessment Plan

**How will we monitor progress toward the goal?**

| Assessment | When | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| (formative checks) |  | Monitor during instruction |
| (CFA) |  | Formal progress check |
| (CFA) |  | Formal progress check |
| (goal assessment) |  | Measure goal achievement |

### Intervention/Extension

**What will we do when students don't learn?**
_____________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________

**What will we do when students already know it?**
_____________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________

## STEP 6: ESTABLISH PROGRESS MONITORING

### Monitoring Schedule

| Date | Data Point | Expected Progress | Actual Progress | On Track? |
|------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|
|      | Baseline   | _____%            | _____%          | N/A       |
|      | Check 1    | _____%            | _____%          | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
|      | Check 2    | _____%            | _____%          | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
|      | Check 3    | _____%            | _____%          | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
|      | Final      | _____%            | _____%          | [ ] Yes [ ] No |

### Decision Rules

**If ON TRACK:**
→ Continue current strategies
→ Celebrate progress with team

**If BELOW EXPECTED PROGRESS:**
→ Analyze what's not working
→ Adjust strategies
→ Intensify efforts
→ Seek additional resources/support

**Important:** Never lower the goal just because progress is slower than hoped. Instead, adjust strategies to accelerate improvement.

## COMMON SMART GOAL MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: Activity-Focused, Not Results-Oriented

❌ "We will implement Daily 5 literacy centers"
✅ "Reading fluency will increase from 45 to 75 words per minute"

❌ "Teachers will use exit tickets"
✅ "Student proficiency on math CFAs will increase from 65% to 82%"

### Mistake 2: Vague, Not Specific

❌ "Students will improve in writing"
✅ "Students' informational writing scores will improve from 2.1 to 3.0 on 4-point rubric"

❌ "Math achievement will increase"
✅ "Proficiency on fraction CFAs will increase from 58% to 80%"

### Mistake 3: No Clear Measurement

❌ "Students will understand fractions better"
✅ "Fraction CFA proficiency will increase from 58% to 80%"

❌ "Reading comprehension will improve"
✅ "Students scoring proficient on reading comprehension CFAs will increase from 63% to 85%"

### Mistake 4: Not Achievable (Too Easy or Too Hard)

❌ Too Easy: "Proficiency will increase from 85% to 87%" (minimal growth)
✅ Just Right: "Proficiency will increase from 62% to 85%" (significant but realistic)
❌ Too Hard: "Proficiency will increase from 30% to 95% in 6 weeks" (unrealistic timeline)

### Mistake 5: No Timeline

❌ "Students will master multiplication"
✅ "By December 15, students will master multiplication facts with 90% proficiency"

## NEXT STEPS

**After developing your SMART goal:**

- [ ] Share goal with team - ensure everyone can commit
- [ ] Share goal with administrator for support
- [ ] Post goal visibly in meeting space
- [ ] Develop detailed action plan for achieving goal
- [ ] Schedule progress monitoring checkpoints (add to calendar)
- [ ] Plan how you'll celebrate incremental progress
- [ ] Revisit goal at every team meeting

---

**Remember:** SMART goals channel team energy, create urgency for improvement, and provide clear targets for collaborative work. Teams with SMART goals achieve significantly stronger results than those working without clear, measurable targets.
