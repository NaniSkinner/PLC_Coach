# Riverside Middle School Math Team: Building Systematic Intervention

## Context

**Riverside Middle School** - 6th-8th grade, 650 students, established PLC structures
**Math Department** - 6 teachers, good collaboration on curriculum but struggled with intervention

**The Problem (Fall 2023):**
After each CFA, 30-40% of students scored below proficiency. Teachers would say "these students need help" but had no systematic response. Students who struggled on Unit 1 were still struggling on Unit 5 - gaps were accumulating.

---

## The Breaking Point

**December 2023 - Mid-Year Benchmark Data:**
- 6th grade: 48% proficient in math
- 7th grade: 42% proficient
- 8th grade: 51% proficient

**Department meeting conversation:**
"We know WHO is struggling. We know WHAT they're struggling with. But we have no structure to actually help them systematically. We're just watching kids fall further behind."

**Decision:** Build a Tier 2 intervention system by end of year.

## Building the System (January-June 2024)

### Step 1: Create Intervention Time (January)

**Challenge:** Packed schedule, no obvious time for intervention

**Solution - "Rotation Block":**
Monday/Wednesday/Friday: 25-minute intervention/extension block after lunch
- Students rotate which period they miss (never miss same class twice in a row)
- All 6 math teachers participate
- Intervention groups based on CFA data

**Result:** Every struggling student gets math intervention 3x/week without missing core math class.

### Step 2: Data-Driven Grouping (Ongoing)

**Before:** Teachers offered "extra help" at lunch. Few students came. No targeting.

**After - Systematic Process:**
1. CFA administered (every 3 weeks)
2. Students scoring <75% automatically assigned to intervention
3. Grouped by specific skill gap (not generic "struggling")
4. Groups change every 3 weeks based on new CFA data

**Example - February:**
- Group A: 7 students struggling with solving equations (Mrs. Johnson leads)
- Group B: 9 students struggling with graphing linear relationships (Mr. Peterson leads)
- Group C: 11 students needing fraction review (Ms. Chen leads)
- Extension: Remaining students work on challenge problems

### Step 3: Targeted Instruction

**Key Realization:** Intervention can't be "more of the same" instruction that didn't work the first time.

**Intervention Strategies Adopted:**
- Explicit instruction (direct teaching, not discovery)
- Worked examples with think-alouds
- Scaffolded worksheets with gradual release
- Immediate corrective feedback
- Manipulatives and visual models

**Training:** Department attended Saturday workshop on intervention strategies (district paid stipends).

### Step 4: Progress Monitoring

**Weekly quick checks:**
- 5-minute probe every Friday
- Students graph their own progress
- Teachers review data together Monday mornings

**Decision Rules:**
- Adequate progress → Continue intervention
- Mastery reached → Exit intervention, join extension
- No progress after 3 weeks → Intensify (daily small group or 1-on-1)

## Results (Spring 2024)

### Quantitative Outcomes

**End-of-Year Benchmark (May 2024):**
- 6th grade: 48% → 64% proficient (16-point gain)
- 7th grade: 42% → 61% proficient (19-point gain)
- 8th grade: 51% → 68% proficient (17-point gain)

**Intervention Effectiveness:**
- 78% of students receiving Tier 2 intervention showed significant improvement
- Average growth for intervention students: 22 percentage points
- 65% of intervention students reached proficiency and exited by year-end

### Qualitative Outcomes

**Teacher Reflections:**
- "For the first time, I feel like we're not just teaching and hoping - we're ensuring students learn"
- "Students who've always struggled are finally catching up"
- "The structure makes it possible to actually respond to needs"

**Student Feedback:**
- "Math intervention isn't embarrassing - lots of kids go, and it actually helps"
- "I like knowing exactly what I need to work on"
- "When I get better at something, I get to move to challenge problems"

## Key Success Factors

1. **Administrative Support**: Principal rearranged master schedule to create intervention block
2. **Team Commitment**: All 6 teachers participated, no one opted out
3. **Data Systems**: Simple spreadsheet tracking who needed what
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Weekly checks showing whether intervention worked
5. **Fluid Grouping**: Groups changed based on data, not static all year

## Challenges Faced

### Challenge 1: Initial Resistance

**Some teachers:** "This is too much work - planning intervention on top of regular teaching"

**Response:** "We're already working hard. This helps our work actually produce results."

### Challenge 2: Scheduling Logistics

**Problem:** Rotation block meant students occasionally missed electives/other classes

**Solution:** Communication with students/parents about why it matters. Rotation ensured no student missed too much of any one class.

### Challenge 3: Extension for Proficient Students

**First attempt:** Proficient students just did homework during intervention block (waste of time)

**Fix:** Created challenge problem sets, enrichment activities led by teacher

---

## Sustainability (2024-2025 School Year)

**Current Status:**
- Intervention block continues
- Now expanding model to reading/ELA
- Training new teachers hired for upcoming year
- Refining progress monitoring tools

**Department Chair:** "Year 1 was about building the structure. Year 2 will be about refining and perfecting it."

---

## Lessons Learned

**What worked:**
- Starting with clear problem and specific goal
- Creating structural time for intervention (didn't rely on voluntary before/after school)
- Targeting specific skills, not generic "help"
- Progress monitoring to know if intervention was working

**What didn't work initially:**
- First attempt at grouping was too broad ("low students")
- Initial extension activities were weak
- Communication with parents about why students were "pulled" was unclear

**Advice for other schools:**
"You don't need permission to start. If you have data showing students need help and protected time for intervention, you can build a system. It doesn't have to be perfect from day one."

## Reflection Questions

1. How did Riverside create intervention time within existing schedule constraints?
2. What made their intervention "systematic" rather than random?
3. Why was progress monitoring critical to their success?
4. How might this model adapt to elementary or high school contexts?
