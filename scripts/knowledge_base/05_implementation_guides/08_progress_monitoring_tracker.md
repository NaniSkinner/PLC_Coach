**Minimal Progress:** Growth less than 5 percentage points over 4 weeks
→ Intensify intervention (increase frequency, reduce group size, or change approach)

**Goal Reached:** Scored at/above proficiency target for 2 consecutive checks
→ Exit intervention, monitor in core instruction

**No Progress:** Flat or declining scores after 6-8 weeks of quality intervention
→ Consider Tier 3 or referral for evaluation
