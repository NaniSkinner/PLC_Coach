# Critical Question 1: Identifying and Teaching Essential Standards

## Introduction

Critical Question 1 - "What do we want students to know and be able to do?" - establishes the foundation for all other PLC work. Without clarity about essential learning outcomes, teams cannot design effective assessments, provide targeted interventions, or ensure all students have access to guaranteed curriculum. This question requires teams to make difficult decisions about prioritization, moving from mile-wide, inch-deep coverage to focused instruction on truly essential content.

## The Challenge of Curriculum Overload

Modern curriculum standards contain far more content than can be adequately taught in available instructional time. Teachers attempting to "cover" everything inevitably teach superficially, exposing students to many topics without ensuring mastery of any. This coverage mentality creates several problems:

**For Students:**
- Overwhelming volume prevents deep understanding
- Essential content receives no more emphasis than peripheral topics
- Struggling learners fall progressively further behind
- Learning becomes disconnected and fragmented

**For Teachers:**
- Constant pressure to move on before students are ready
- Inability to provide enrichment for advanced learners
- Frustration that nothing is taught well
- Unclear expectations about what matters most

Critical Question 1 addresses this challenge by requiring teams to identify the subset of standards that are truly essential - typically 40-50% of all standards.

## What Makes a Standard Essential?

Teams use three primary criteria to identify essential standards:

### Criterion 1: Endurance

**Essential standards have staying power beyond a single test or unit.** The knowledge and skills will be relevant throughout students' lives, not just in the immediate instructional context.

**Questions to Ask:**
- Will students need this knowledge 5 years from now? 10 years?
- Does this standard represent foundational understanding in the discipline?
- Will students encounter these concepts repeatedly in future courses?

**Examples:**
- *Essential:* Reading comprehension strategies (endure throughout life)
- *Not Essential:* Specific details from a particular historical event (limited endurance)
- *Essential:* Mathematical problem-solving processes (endure across contexts)
- *Not Essential:* Memorizing specific formulas that can be looked up (limited endurance)

### Criterion 2: Leverage

**Essential standards provide knowledge and skills valuable in multiple disciplines,** not just the subject where they're taught. These cross-curricular standards have multiplier effects on learning.

**Questions to Ask:**
- Will mastery of this standard help students in other subject areas?
- Does this standard develop broadly applicable skills?
- Can this learning transfer to real-world situations beyond school?

**Examples:**
- *Essential:* Writing clear explanations (leverages across all subjects)
- *Not Essential:* Subject-specific vocabulary with limited application
- *Essential:* Data analysis and interpretation (leverages across disciplines)
- *Not Essential:* Isolated calculation procedures with no broader application

### Criterion 3: Readiness for Next Level

**Essential standards are prerequisites for success in subsequent courses or grade levels.** Students who don't master these standards will struggle in future learning.

**Questions to Ask:**
- Is this standard foundational for next year's curriculum?
- Will students be unable to access future content without mastering this?
- Do teachers in the next grade level depend on students knowing this?

**Examples:**
- *Essential:* Place value understanding (prerequisite for all future math)
- *Not Essential:* Memorizing state capitals (not needed for future geography)
- *Essential:* Fraction concepts (prerequisite for algebra and beyond)
- *Not Essential:* Specific poetry forms (not prerequisites for future English)

## The Process of Identifying Essential Standards

### Step 1: Individual Review

Before meeting as a team, each member independently reviews all standards for their grade level or course, flagging those meeting essentiality criteria. This individual preparation ensures all team members engage thoughtfully with the full curriculum.

### Step 2: Initial Team Discussion

Teams share their individual selections, discussing where they agree and disagree about essential standards. The goal is not immediate consensus but rather understanding different perspectives on what matters most.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Which standards did we all identify as essential?
- Where do our selections differ, and why?
- What criteria influenced our decisions?
- Are we being rigorous enough in our prioritization?

### Step 3: Vertical Team Input

Before finalizing selections, teams should seek input from teachers in adjacent grade levels:
- Previous grade: What foundations do you build that we depend on?
- Next grade: What must students master here to succeed with you?

This vertical alignment prevents gaps and redundancies across grade levels.

### Step 4: Consensus Building

Teams work toward consensus on essential standards, understanding that not everyone must agree completely but all must commit to teaching the identified standards. The goal is approximately 40-50% of total standards marked as essential.

**If Consensus Proves Difficult:**
- Revisit essentiality criteria together
- Examine data on where students currently struggle
- Consider time required to teach each standard adequately
- Seek input from curriculum specialists or administrators

### Step 5: Documentation

Teams create clear documentation of essential standards, including:
- List of essential standards by reporting period
- Brief rationale for why each was selected
- Estimated instructional time for each standard
- Cross-reference to state/district standards

This documentation guides all subsequent work: assessment development, pacing, intervention planning.

## Unpacking Essential Standards

Identifying essential standards is only the first step. Teams must then "unpack" each standard to clarify exactly what students need to know and be able to do.

### The Unpacking Process

**1. Identify Key Verbs (Skills)**

What must students be able to DO with the content?
- Analyze, evaluate, create, explain, compare, apply, etc.
- Note the cognitive demand implied by these verbs

**2. Identify Key Nouns (Content)**

What specific content must students understand?
- Concepts, topics, procedures, principles
- Prerequisite knowledge required

**3. Determine Essential Vocabulary**

What academic language must students master?
- Technical terms specific to the standard
- Context-specific meanings of common words
- Phrases with specialized meanings

**4. Clarify the Level of Rigor**

How deeply must students understand this content?
- What does proficiency look like?
- What examples demonstrate mastery?
- How complex must student work be?

**5. Identify Common Misconceptions**

What misunderstandings predictably emerge?
- Where do students typically struggle?
- What incorrect thinking must be addressed?
- How can instruction proactively prevent confusion?

### Creating Learning Targets

From unpacked standards, teams develop clear learning targets written in student-friendly language:

**Standard Format:**
"Students will be able to [verb] [content] [context]."

**Examples:**
- "I can explain how characters' actions advance the plot."
- "I can solve multi-step word problems using all four operations."
- "I can analyze how scientific discoveries impact society."

These targets are shared with students, posted in classrooms, and referenced throughout instruction.

## Creating Guaranteed and Viable Curriculum

Identifying essential standards enables teams to create **guaranteed and viable curriculum** - perhaps the most important outcome of answering Critical Question 1.

### Guaranteed Curriculum

**All students have access to the same essential learning,** regardless of which teacher they have. This doesn't mean identical instruction - teachers use varied approaches - but the content and rigor remain consistent.

**Elements of Guaranteed Curriculum:**
- Common pacing guides ensuring timely access to all essential standards
- Shared learning targets and proficiency expectations
- Equivalent rigor and cognitive demand across classrooms
- Consistent use of academic vocabulary and concepts

**What's NOT Guaranteed:**
- Specific instructional activities (teachers have autonomy)
- Supplemental materials and resources
- Classroom management approaches
- Individual teaching styles and personalities

### Viable Curriculum

**The curriculum can be adequately taught in available time.** By focusing on essential standards, teams create space for depth rather than superficial coverage.

**Indicators of Viability:**
- Instructional calendar shows sufficient time for each essential standard
- Pacing accounts for assessment, re-teaching, and intervention
- Teachers aren't perpetually rushing to cover content
- Time exists for students to apply learning in authentic contexts

**Testing Viability:**
- Calculate total days available (subtract assessments, interruptions)
- Estimate time needed for each essential standard
- Add time for review, assessment, and re-teaching
- If total exceeds available days, further prioritize

## Implementing Essential Standards

### Communicating to Stakeholders

**Parents/Families:**
- Explain how essential standards benefit their children
- Clarify that focusing on essentials enables deeper learning
- Provide resources showing how non-essential content is still addressed
- Share learning targets so families understand current focus

**Students:**
- Post learning targets in student-friendly language
- Help students track their progress toward targets
- Explain why these particular standards matter
- Connect standards to future learning and real-world application

**Administrators:**
- Share documentation of essential standards selection process
- Demonstrate alignment with district/state priorities
- Show how this work enables more effective intervention
- Request support for protected collaborative time

### Adjusting Instructional Practice

Focusing on essential standards requires changes in teaching:

**Depth Over Breadth:**
- Spend more time on essential content
- Provide multiple practice opportunities
- Develop deeper conceptual understanding
- Create rich performance tasks

**Strategic Treatment of Non-Essential Standards:**
- Integrate where natural connections exist
- Teach through extension activities for proficient students
- Address briefly without deep assessment
- Acknowledge honestly what won't be covered deeply

**Responsive Pacing:**
- Don't move on until most students master essentials
- Adjust pacing based on assessment results
- Provide intervention for struggling learners
- Offer extension for those demonstrating proficiency

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: "Everything Feels Essential"

**Problem:** Teams struggle to prioritize because all standards feel important.

**Solution:**
- Apply essentiality criteria rigorously
- Ask: "What's the worst that happens if students don't master this?"
- Remember that focusing on essentials doesn't mean others aren't taught
- Start by identifying clearly non-essential standards

### Challenge 2: Testing Pressure

**Problem:** State assessments include content beyond essential standards.

**Solution:**
- Remember that deep learning of essentials creates transferable skills
- Students with solid foundations adapt more easily to new content
- Test prep can address assessed non-essentials closer to testing
- Data consistently shows focused instruction improves overall achievement

### Challenge 3: Teacher Autonomy Concerns

**Problem:** Teachers worry that guaranteed curriculum removes professional discretion.

**Solution:**
- Emphasize that HOW to teach essentials remains each teacher's choice
- Clarify that autonomy over peripheral content continues
- Frame as collective responsibility rather than compliance
- Show how guaranteed curriculum creates equity for students

### Challenge 4: Time Investment

**Problem:** The process of identifying and unpacking standards is time-consuming.

**Solution:**
- Recognize this is one-time intensive work with long-term payoff
- Start with one subject or a subset of standards
- Use summer or extended planning time
- Access district-developed essential standards if available

### Challenge 5: Changing Standards

**Problem:** When standards change, the work must be repeated.

**Solution:**
- Build capacity for the process, not just the product
- Document decision-making to help with future revisions
- View standards changes as opportunities to refine curriculum
- Most changes are additions/refinements, not complete overhauls

## Monitoring Implementation

Teams should regularly assess whether essential standards are truly driving instruction:

**Evidence of Effective Implementation:**
- Common pacing guides show sufficient time for essentials
- Assessments focus predominantly on essential standards
- Intervention plans target essential content
- Classroom observations show depth of instruction on essentials
- Student work demonstrates rigor appropriate to standards

**Red Flags:**
- Teachers significantly off-pace from agreed timeline
- Assessments continue testing non-essential content
- Instruction remains superficial despite reduced breadth
- Teams rarely reference essential standards documentation

## Connection to Other Critical Questions

Essential standards drive answers to subsequent questions:

**Question 2 (Assessment):** Common assessments must align tightly with essential standards. Teams should not assess content they haven't identified as essential.

**Question 3 (Intervention):** Limited time for intervention must focus on essential learning. Students receive extra support on content that matters most.

**Question 4 (Extension):** Proficient students extend their understanding of essential standards rather than simply moving faster through more standards.

When essential standards truly guide the work, all four critical questions align coherently.

## Conclusion

Critical Question 1 - identifying what students must know and be able to do - is foundational PLC work that enables everything that follows. By courageously prioritizing truly essential learning, teams create conditions where all students can achieve mastery. This requires moving beyond the myth that everything can be taught with equal emphasis and accepting that focusing on what matters most serves students better than superficial coverage of everything.

The process is challenging, requiring difficult decisions and significant time investment. However, teams that successfully identify essential standards report:
- Reduced stress from trying to cover everything
- Deeper, more satisfying instruction
- Improved student learning outcomes
- More effective use of intervention time
- Greater coherence across classrooms

Most importantly, students benefit from guaranteed access to the learning that matters most, taught with the time and depth necessary for genuine mastery.

## Reflection Questions

1. Has your team formally identified essential standards? If so, what process did you use? If not, what prevents this work?

2. To what extent does your current curriculum prioritize depth over breadth? What evidence supports your assessment?

3. How do essential standards (or lack thereof) influence your assessment practices? Intervention planning? Pacing decisions?

4. What barriers prevent your team from fully implementing a guaranteed and viable curriculum based on essential standards?

5. How might focusing on essential standards change your instructional practice? What would you do differently?
