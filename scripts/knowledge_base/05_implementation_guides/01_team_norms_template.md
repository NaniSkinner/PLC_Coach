# Team Norms Development Template and Guide

## Purpose of Team Norms

Team norms are agreements about how team members will work together. Effective norms create psychological safety, clarify expectations, and provide a reference point when team dynamics become challenging. Teams with clear, agreed-upon norms are more productive, handle conflict better, and build stronger collaborative relationships.

## Characteristics of Effective Team Norms

**Effective norms are:**
- **Specific:** Clear enough that everyone understands what they mean
- **Observable:** You can see/hear when someone is following or violating them
- **Few in number:** 4-7 norms (too many become unmanageable)
- **Positively stated:** Focus on what TO do, not what NOT to do
- **Collaboratively developed:** Team creates them together, not imposed
- **Revisited regularly:** Team reflects on how well they're living the norms

## Norms Development Process

### Step 1: Individual Reflection (5 minutes)

Each team member privately answers:

**Think about the best team you've ever been part of. What behaviors made that team effective?**
- _____________________________________
- _____________________________________
- _____________________________________

**Think about challenging team experiences. What behaviors would have made those teams more effective?**
- _____________________________________
- _____________________________________
- _____________________________________

**What's most important to YOU in team collaboration?**
- _____________________________________
- _____________________________________

### Step 2: Share and Compile (15 minutes)

**Round-robin sharing:** Each person shares one idea at a time. Recorder writes all suggestions on chart paper. Keep going around until all ideas are shared.

**Typical suggestions might include:**
- Start and end on time
- Listen actively without interrupting
- Assume positive intentions
- Focus on student learning, not adult comfort
- Share both strengths and struggles honestly
- Keep conversations confidential
- Challenge ideas, not people
- Come prepared
- Silence phones/laptops
- Follow through on commitments

### Step 3: Cluster and Prioritize (10 minutes)

Look for themes in the brainstormed list. Group similar ideas together.

**Example clusters:**
- Time management (punctuality, staying on agenda)
- Communication (listening, assuming positive intent)
- Participation (all voices heard, balanced airtime)
- Accountability (following through, coming prepared)
- Focus (student learning, data-driven)

### Step 4: Draft 4-7 Norms (10 minutes)

For each cluster, write one norm that captures the theme. Make it:
- **Specific:** Not "respect each other" but "listen without interrupting and seek to understand before responding"
- **Action-oriented:** Verbs showing what to DO
- **Positively stated:** "We will..." not "We won't..."

**Example Norms:**

**❌ Too Vague:** "Be respectful"
**✅ Specific:** "Listen actively, seek to understand, and assume positive intentions"

**❌ Negative:** "Don't dominate the conversation"
**✅ Positive:** "Monitor our own airtime and ensure all voices are heard"

**❌ Not Observable:** "Value collaboration"
**✅ Observable:** "Come prepared, participate fully, and follow through on commitments"

### Step 5: Consensus Check (5 minutes)

Read each proposed norm aloud. For each one, ask:
- "Can everyone commit to this norm?"
- "Is this norm clear to everyone?"
- "Should we revise any language?"

Aim for consensus (everyone can support it) not majority vote.

## Sample Team Norms Template

**[Team Name] Team Norms**
**Date Established: ___________**

As members of this collaborative team, we commit to:

**1. Time and Focus**
- Start and end on time
- Stay present (minimize devices and distractions)
- Follow our agenda and keep discussions focused on student learning

**2. Communication**
- Listen actively and seek to understand before responding
- Assume positive intentions
- Challenge ideas respectfully while maintaining relationships

**3. Participation**
- Come prepared with materials and data reviewed in advance
- Ensure all voices are heard
- Share both successes and struggles openly

**4. Accountability**
- Follow through on commitments made during meetings
- Hold ourselves and each other accountable with respect
- Keep team conversations confidential

**5. Data-Driven Decisions**
- Ground discussions in evidence about student learning
- Separate interpretation from observation when analyzing data
- Focus on what's in our control to improve

**Signatures:**

## Making Norms Actionable

### Displaying Norms
- Post norms visibly in meeting space
- Include norms at top of meeting agendas
- Provide team members with personal copies

### Reviewing Norms
**Start each meeting:** Quickly read norms aloud (30 seconds)

**Assign a Norms Monitor:** Rotating role - one person per meeting observes team adherence to norms

**End each meeting (2 minutes):**
- "How did we do living our norms today?"
- Norms Monitor shares observations
- Team identifies one norm to emphasize next time

### Revisiting and Revising Norms

**Quarterly Reflection (15 minutes):**

**Discuss:**
1. Which norms are we consistently living?
2. Which norms do we struggle with?
3. What's getting in the way of following our norms?
4. Do any norms need clarification or revision?
5. Are any norms no longer needed?
6. Are there new norms we should add?

**Revise as needed:** Norms aren't set in stone. Update them based on team needs.

## Addressing Norm Violations

### When Someone Violates a Norm

**In the Moment (Norms Monitor or any team member):**
- Gentle reminder: "Let's remember our norm about listening without interrupting"
- Redirect to norm: "Our norm is to focus on student learning - can we return to the data?"

**After the Meeting (If pattern emerges):**
Team leader has private conversation:
- "I've noticed [specific behavior]. Our team norm is [specific norm]. What's getting in the way of following this norm?"
- Problem-solve together
- Agree on path forward

**If Violations Continue:**
Team discussion:
- "We agreed to [norm] but we're consistently struggling with this. What should we do?"
- Options: Clarify what norm means, remove norm if not important, address specific behaviors, seek outside facilitation

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Too Many Norms**
Problem: Teams create 15 norms trying to cover every scenario
Solution: Limit to 4-7 key norms. Can't monitor everything.

**Pitfall 2: Vague Norms**
Problem: "Be professional" or "Show respect" - everyone interprets differently
Solution: Make norms specific enough that you know what they look like in practice

**Pitfall 3: Creating Norms and Forgetting Them**
Problem: Develop norms in August, never reference again
Solution: Review at every meeting, reflect regularly, revise as needed

**Pitfall 4: Leader-Imposed Norms**
Problem: Principal or team leader creates norms, tells team "these are our norms"
Solution: Team collaboratively develops norms together. Ownership matters.

**Pitfall 5: No Accountability**
Problem: Norms exist but violations are ignored
Solution: Gentle accountability in the moment, reflection at meeting end

## Norms for Specific Scenarios

### Norms for Data Analysis Meetings

Consider adding:
- "We will describe what we observe before interpreting what it means"
- "We will approach data with curiosity, not judgment"
- "We will focus on patterns and learning opportunities, not individual teacher evaluation"

### Norms for Conflict or Difficult Conversations

Consider adding:
- "We will speak directly to the person, not about them to others"
- "We will name disagreements and work through them rather than avoiding conflict"
- "We will assume we need to understand others' perspectives, not convince them of ours"

### Norms for Remote/Hybrid Meetings

Consider adding:
- "We will use cameras to stay connected"
- "We will use 'raise hand' feature to ensure all voices are heard"
- "We will arrive 2 minutes early to handle technical issues"

## Sample Completed Norms

**Example 1: Elementary Grade-Level Team**

**Our Team Norms:**
1. **Punctuality & Preparation:** We arrive on time with our data and materials reviewed and ready to discuss
2. **Focused Engagement:** We stay present and focused on student learning throughout our meetings
3. **Balanced Participation:** We actively listen, invite quiet voices to share, and monitor our own airtime
4. **Honest Sharing:** We openly share both successes and struggles, knowing this team is a safe space for growth
5. **Follow-Through:** We do what we say we'll do and check in with each other on commitments made

**Example 2: High School Department Team**

**Our Team Norms:**
1. **Student-Centered Focus:** We ground all decisions in evidence about student learning
2. **Respectful Challenge:** We question ideas and assumptions while maintaining positive relationships
3. **Shared Responsibility:** We view all students as "our students" and hold collective responsibility for their learning
4. **Confidentiality:** What's shared in this room stays in this room
5. **Accountability with Grace:** We hold each other accountable while assuming everyone is doing their best

## Reflection Questions

After establishing your norms, discuss:

1. How will we know if we're living these norms effectively?

2. What will we do when someone (including ourselves) violates a norm?

3. How often should we reflect on our norms? Who will facilitate this reflection?

4. What support might we need from our administrator or coach to uphold these norms?

5. How will we introduce these norms to new team members who join mid-year?

## Next Steps

- [ ] Schedule norms development meeting (45-60 minutes)
- [ ] Complete norms development process as team
- [ ] Post norms visibly in meeting space
- [ ] Add norms to meeting agenda template
- [ ] Assign rotating Norms Monitor role
- [ ] Schedule quarterly norms review (add to calendar now)
- [ ] Plan how to introduce norms to new team members

**Remember:** The best norms are the ones teams actively use, not the ones that sound impressive on paper. Start simple, live them consistently, and revise as you learn.
