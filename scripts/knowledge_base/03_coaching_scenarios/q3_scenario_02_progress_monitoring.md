# Coaching Scenario: Progress Monitoring Intervention Effectiveness

## Context

Tom teaches 6th-grade math and has 8 students receiving Tier 2 intervention for fraction concepts. The intervention has been running for 4 weeks, but Tom doesn't know if it's working. He hasn't checked progress since the initial CFA that identified these students. The team needs guidance on progress monitoring to determine whether to continue, intensify, or exit students from intervention.

**Context:** 8 students in Tier 2 intervention (fractions), 4 weeks without progress monitoring

**Challenge:** How to monitor intervention effectiveness and make data-based decisions about student placement

## The Coaching Conversation

### Turn 1: Teacher Opens

**Tom:** I have eight 6th graders getting intervention on fractions three times a week for the past four weeks. I'm teaching them, they're engaged, they seem to understand during our small-group sessions. But I honestly don't know if it's working. Should I keep going? Have they learned enough to exit intervention? I feel like I'm flying blind.

**Coach Response:**

Tom, you've identified a critical gap - intervention without progress monitoring is like driving without checking if you're going the right direction. You might be working hard but not making progress. Let me ask: What specific fraction skills are you targeting in intervention, and how will you know when students have mastered them enough to exit?

### Turns 2-8: [Conversation continues covering:]

**Progress Monitoring Framework:**

**1. Establish Baseline**
- Students scored 40-55% on fraction CFA (initial data point)
- Exit criterion: 75%+ on fraction assessment

**2. Create Brief Progress Checks**
- 5-10 minute probe every 1-2 weeks
- Assess same skills as intervention targets
- Example: 8 fraction problems matching intervention content

**3. Graph Progress Over Time**
- Visual display showing each student's trajectory
- Expected growth: ~5-10 percentage points per week with effective intervention
- Decision rules: below expected = intensify, at/above = continue, mastered = exit

**4. Decision Points Every 2-3 Weeks**
- Review progress monitoring data as team
- Identify students not responding (need Tier 3)
- Identify students ready to exit (reached proficiency)
- Adjust instruction for students in between

**Coach's Protocol:**
- **Week 0**: CFA identifies students (baseline: 40-55%)
- **Week 2**: First progress check (target: 55-65%)
- **Week 4**: Second progress check (target: 65-75%)
- **Week 6**: Exit assessment (target: 75%+)

**For Non-Responders:** Students not showing growth after 4 weeks need:
- More intensive intervention (Tier 3: daily, smaller group, more explicit)
- Different instructional approach (current method isn't working)
- Screening for learning disabilities (persistent struggle despite quality intervention)

**For Tom's Current Situation:**
- It's Week 4 with no progress check - address immediately
- Give quick 10-problem fraction assessment this week
- If students score 70%+, they've made great progress (40→70% in 4 weeks)
- If still at 45-50%, intervention isn't working - need to change approach
- If at 60%, progress is happening but need 2 more weeks

**Outcome:** Tom commits to administering progress check this week. Will graph results and present to team next meeting. Team will establish protocol: progress checks every 2 weeks for all Tier 2 interventions going forward.

## Coaching Analysis

### Key Coaching Moves
- Diagnosed that intervention without monitoring is ineffective
- Provided simple progress monitoring protocol (brief checks, graphing, decision rules)
- Helped Tom see progress monitoring drives intervention adjustments
- Addressed what to do with non-responders (intensify to Tier 3)

### PLC Concepts
- Intervention must be monitored to be effective
- Data-based decision rules for continuing/intensifying/exiting intervention
- Time as variable: Students need different amounts of time to master content
- Systematic response: Tier 2 non-responders need Tier 3, not just more time

### Likely Outcomes
- Tom will discover which students have progressed and which haven't
- Non-responders will be identified and moved to more intensive support
- Students who've mastered content will exit intervention
- Team will adopt progress monitoring protocol for all interventions

## Reflection Questions
1. Why is intervention without progress monitoring ineffective?
2. What are decision rules for continuing, intensifying, or exiting intervention?
3. How does progress monitoring differ from CFAs?
