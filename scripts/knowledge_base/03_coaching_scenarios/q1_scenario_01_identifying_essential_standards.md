# Coaching Scenario: Identifying Essential Standards for Grade 3 Math

## Context

Sarah is a third-grade teacher who is part of a newly formed PLC team. Her team is beginning the process of identifying essential standards in mathematics but feels overwhelmed by the number of standards they're expected to teach. The team has 45 math standards across their curriculum and is struggling to determine which ones are truly essential. This is their first formal attempt at prioritization.

**Team Composition:**
- 4 third-grade teachers
- Mixed experience levels (2-15 years)
- First year working as a formal PLC
- School transitioning to PLC model

**Current Situation:**
- Team reviewed all 45 grade 3 math standards in previous meeting
- Teachers expressed concern they "can't possibly teach everything deeply"
- Some disagreement about which standards matter most
- Pressure from administration to "cover" all standards
- Upcoming planning meeting in 2 days

## The Coaching Conversation

### Turn 1: Teacher Opens

**Sarah:** I'm really struggling with this essential standards work. Our team met yesterday and we looked at all 45 math standards for third grade. Everyone just kept saying, "They're all important!" We didn't eliminate a single one. How are we supposed to choose what's essential when the state says all of them are required?

**Coach's Purpose:** Acknowledge concern, clarify misconception about "eliminating" standards, introduce prioritization vs. elimination framework.

**Coach Response:**

I can hear the frustration, Sarah, and what you're experiencing is completely normal. Almost every team struggles with this initially. Let me address your core concern: identifying essential standards doesn't mean eliminating or not teaching other standards. You'll still teach all 45 - that's not changing.

What essential standards identification does is help you prioritize. Think of it this way: some standards are foundations that students absolutely must master because other learning depends on them. Others are important but less foundational. The essential standards get more time, deeper instruction, common assessments, and systematic intervention. The others still get taught, but perhaps not with the same depth or intervention structures.

Here's what I'm curious about: when you said "they're all important," did anyone on your team distinguish between standards that are prerequisites for future learning versus those that stand alone? That distinction might be a starting point.

### Turn 2: Teacher Responds with Specific Example

**Sarah:** That's helpful - we definitely didn't talk about it that way. We just kept thinking we had to "cut" standards and that felt wrong. So if I understand correctly, we're really trying to figure out which ones need the most attention?

One thing that did come up was multiplication. Everyone agreed that's critical for third grade. We teach it in the second quarter, and honestly, a lot of kids still struggle with it by the end of the year. Is that the kind of thing you mean by essential?

**Coach's Purpose:** Affirm her reframe, use multiplication as concrete example to apply prioritization criteria, introduce the three filters.

**Coach Response:**

Exactly! You've got the right mindset now. Multiplication in third grade is actually a perfect example to explore. Let's apply the three essential standards filters to multiplication and see how this works:

**Filter 1: Endurance** - Will students need this skill beyond this grade level?
For multiplication, absolutely yes. Fourth grade division, fractions, multi-digit multiplication, algebra - all depend on understanding multiplication. This clearly has endurance.

**Filter 2: Leverage** - Does this standard help students in other areas of learning?
Again, yes. Multiplication connects to arrays, area models, repeated addition, and even skip counting. It appears across math topics and even in science and real-world contexts.

**Filter 3: Readiness for Next Level** - Is this a prerequisite for success in fourth grade?
Definitely. Fourth-grade teachers consistently say that students who haven't mastered multiplication facts and concepts struggle significantly.

So multiplication passes all three filters strongly - that's a clear essential standard. Now, can you think of a third-grade math standard that might not pass these filters as strongly? Something that's good to know but perhaps doesn't have the same leverage or endurance?

---

### Turn 3: Teacher Identifies Non-Essential Standard

**Sarah:** Hmm, that's interesting. Let me think... Oh! What about reading and writing time to the nearest minute on analog clocks? We spend time on that, and it's in our curriculum, but honestly, most kids use digital clocks at home. It's useful, but it doesn't really connect to other math concepts the way multiplication does.

I guess it wouldn't pass the leverage filter very well? And while it's nice if fourth graders can do it, I don't think it's really a prerequisite for fourth-grade math content.

**Coach's Purpose:** Affirm her analysis, help team see this doesn't mean "don't teach it," introduce concept of teaching vs. assessing for mastery.

**Coach Response:**

That's excellent analysis, Sarah! You're exactly right. Time-telling to the nearest minute has some value - it's a life skill and it does appear in your standards. But when we apply the filters:

- Endurance: Moderate at best - useful but not critical long-term
- Leverage: Low - doesn't connect to many other math concepts
- Readiness: Low - not a prerequisite for fourth-grade mathematics

This is a perfect example of a supporting standard rather than an essential standard. You'd still teach it, but here's the difference:

**Essential Standard (Multiplication):**
- Dedicated time for deep understanding
- Common formative assessments every 2-3 weeks
- Intervention for students not reaching proficiency
- Extension for students who master it quickly

**Supporting Standard (Time to nearest minute):**
- Introduce and practice the concept
- Informal checks for understanding
- Perhaps included on a mixed-skills assessment
- No formal intervention system

Does that distinction make sense? And here's my next question: If your team applied these three filters to all 45 standards, roughly how many do you think would emerge as truly essential - as foundational as multiplication?

---

### Turn 4: Teacher Estimates and Asks About Quantity

**Sarah:** That distinction does make sense. I think we've been trying to do deep instruction, assessment, and intervention for everything, and it's exhausting. We're spread so thin.

If I'm being honest, I think maybe 12-15 standards would be truly essential by those filters? Maybe even fewer? But I'm worried - is that too few? What if we're wrong about what's essential? And won't parents or administration think we're not teaching enough?

**Coach's Purpose:** Validate her estimate, address fears about quantity, provide research-based guidance, focus on quality over quantity.

**Coach Response:**

Sarah, your instinct is spot-on. Research on essential standards suggests that typically 10-15 standards per content area per year is the right range. Your estimate of 12-15 for third-grade math aligns perfectly with what effective teams identify.

Let me address your worries directly:

**"What if we're wrong?"**
This is why you work as a team and apply consistent criteria. You're not just guessing - you're using the three filters systematically. Plus, essential standards aren't set in stone. Teams revisit them annually based on data. If you discover a standard is more critical than you thought, you add it to the essential list next year.

**"Won't people think we're not teaching enough?"**
Actually, the opposite is true. You're teaching all 45 standards, but teaching 12-15 of them *really well* with guaranteed mastery for all students. Right now, you're probably teaching all 45 superficially with inconsistent results. Which approach actually serves students better?

Here's what I'd suggest for your team meeting: Start with the standards everyone immediately agrees are essential - multiplication is one. What are 3-4 others your whole team would agree on without debate? Building from consensus is easier than arguing about borderline standards.

What comes to mind as other obvious essentials?

---

### Turn 5: Teacher Identifies Additional Essential Standards

**Sarah:** Okay, that makes me feel better. Let me think about what else would be obvious...

Place value for sure - understanding hundreds, tens, and ones. That's foundational for everything else. Fractions as parts of a whole - that's huge for fourth grade and beyond. Oh, and addition and subtraction within 1,000, especially multi-digit problems.

Actually, as I list these, I'm realizing they're all the things that keep coming up again and again throughout the year. They're the concepts that if kids don't get them, they struggle with almost everything else we do.

Is that another way to think about essential standards - the things that create the most struggle when students don't understand them?

**Coach's Purpose:** Affirm her growing understanding, help her see the pattern, introduce the idea of sharing with team.

**Coach Response:**

Yes! You've just articulated something really important: essential standards are often the standards that, when missing, cause the most difficulty. You're seeing the pattern now.

Place value, fractions, multi-digit addition/subtraction, and multiplication - these are exactly the kind of foundational concepts that pass all three filters. Notice how they all connect to each other? Place value enables multi-digit operations. Multiplication builds toward fractions. These aren't isolated skills - they're a web of connected understanding.

Now, here's what I'm wondering: You've identified about 5 standards that seem clearly essential. Your team has four teachers. What if each teacher came to your next meeting with their personal list of "clearly essential" standards? My guess is you'd find significant overlap on these big concepts, which would make consensus easier.

Then you could spend your meeting time on the standards where people disagree. Does that seem like a productive way to structure your meeting?

---

### Turn 6: Teacher Asks About Process for Team Meeting

**Sarah:** Yes! That would be so much better than our last meeting where we just went through all 45 standards in order and got nowhere. If we start with agreement, we'll feel like we're making progress.

But what about the ones we disagree on? How do we resolve those? What if I think a standard is essential but others don't? Or what if we still end up with too many - like 25 standards instead of 15?

**Coach's Purpose:** Provide concrete protocol for decision-making, address how to handle disagreement, introduce data-based decision making.

**Coach Response:**

Great questions. Let me give you a simple protocol for your meeting:

**Step 1: Individual Lists (5 minutes)**
Each teacher independently lists 10-15 standards they consider essential using the three filters.

**Step 2: Share and Mark Consensus (10 minutes)**
Create a master list. Mark standards that appear on all four teachers' lists. These are your "no-brainer" essentials - probably 6-10 standards.

**Step 3: Discuss Disagreements (30 minutes)**
For standards that some teachers listed and others didn't, the teacher who listed it makes a case:
- "Why does this pass the endurance filter?"
- "How does it provide leverage?"
- "Why is it critical for fourth-grade readiness?"

If they can make a compelling case, it stays on the essential list. If not, it moves to supporting standards.

**Step 4: Refine to Final List (15 minutes)**
If you still have more than 15, ask: "If we could only guarantee mastery of 12 standards this year, which 12 would have the biggest impact on student success?"

**For standards where you truly disagree:** Look at data. What do fourth-grade teachers in your building say students need most? What does state testing data show? Where do your current students struggle most? Let evidence break ties, not opinions.

Does this give you a structure you could bring to your team?

### Turn 7: Teacher Expresses Confidence but Has Implementation Question

**Sarah:** This is really helpful. I feel like I could actually facilitate this conversation now. I'm going to email my team tonight and ask everyone to come with their list of 10-15 using those three filters.

One more question though: Once we've identified our essential standards - let's say we end up with 13 - what happens next? Do we teach those first? Do we reorganize our whole curriculum? Our pacing guide has multiplication in second quarter, but place value in first quarter. Does the order matter?

**Coach's Purpose:** Preview the next steps, reassure about curriculum order, connect to Questions 2-4, avoid overwhelming with too much detail.

**Coach Response:**

Excellent question, and I love that you're thinking ahead. Here's the short answer: You don't need to reorganize your curriculum order. If your pacing guide has place value in first quarter and multiplication in second quarter, that's fine. Essential standards aren't about sequence - they're about emphasis and systematic response.

Here's what changes once you identify essential standards:

**During instruction of essential standards:**
- Plan more instructional time
- Teach with greater depth
- Create common formative assessments (Question 2)
- Have intervention plans ready (Question 3)
- Prepare extension for proficient students (Question 4)

**During instruction of supporting standards:**
- Still teach the content
- Use informal checks for understanding
- Less emphasis on universal mastery
- May be included on mixed assessments

Your team's next steps after identifying essentials would be:
1. Unpack each essential standard (what exactly does proficiency look like?)
2. Develop common formative assessments for each essential
3. Plan intervention and extension structures

But don't worry about all of that yet. First, just get your team to agreement on which 12-15 standards are essential. That's the foundation for everything else.

Does that help you see the path forward?

---

### Turn 8: Teacher Confirms Understanding and Plans Next Steps

**Sarah:** Yes, absolutely. Okay, so here's what I'm going to do:

1. Email my team tonight with the three filters and ask everyone to bring a list of 10-15 essential standards to our Wednesday meeting
2. Use that four-step protocol you gave me to structure our meeting
3. Once we have our final list of essentials, we'll start talking about what each one really means and how we'll assess it

I'm actually feeling excited about this instead of overwhelmed. I think the key thing I learned is that we're prioritizing, not eliminating. And that we can use criteria instead of just opinions to make decisions.

One last thing - should I share that protocol you gave me with my principal? She's been asking what our team is working on, and I think she'd appreciate seeing that we have a real process.

**Coach's Purpose:** Affirm her plan, encourage documentation, suggest principal communication, reinforce her growing leadership.

**Coach Response:**

Sarah, your plan is excellent. You've gone from feeling overwhelmed to having clear, concrete next steps. That's exactly what we're hoping for.

Absolutely share the protocol with your principal. In fact, I'd suggest framing it this way: "Our team is systematically identifying essential standards using research-based criteria - endurance, leverage, and readiness for next level. Here's the protocol we're using for our decision-making process."

Principals love seeing structured, purposeful work. It shows your team is being thoughtful and intentional.

One more suggestion: After your Wednesday meeting, document your final list of essential standards and the rationale for why each one passed the filters. This serves two purposes:
1. It creates institutional memory for your team
2. It protects your decisions if anyone questions them later

You can say, "We chose multiplication as essential because it has endurance (used through high school), leverage (connects to division, fractions, area, algebra), and is critical for fourth-grade readiness."

I'm confident your meeting will be productive. Would you like to touch base after Wednesday to talk about how it went and what comes next?

## Coaching Analysis

### Effective Coaching Moves Used

**1. Reframing the Problem**
The coach immediately addressed Sarah's misconception that essential standards means "eliminating" standards, reframing it as prioritization and emphasis.

**2. Concrete Examples**
Used multiplication and time-telling as tangible examples to illustrate abstract concepts like the three filters.

**3. Gradual Release**
Started by applying filters to examples, then asked Sarah to apply filters herself, building her capacity progressively.

**4. Anticipating Concerns**
Addressed Sarah's worries about quantity, being wrong, and stakeholder reactions proactively.

**5. Actionable Protocol**
Provided step-by-step meeting protocol Sarah could immediately use, not just theory.

**6. Connecting to Broader Framework**
Briefly mentioned Questions 2-4 to show how essential standards fit into larger PLC work without overwhelming.

**7. Building Confidence**
Affirmed Sarah's thinking throughout, positioning her as capable of leading this work with her team.

### Key PLC Concepts Demonstrated

- **Three Big Ideas:** Focus on learning (mastery of essentials), collaborative culture (team decision-making), results orientation (data-based choices)
- **Question 1:** Identifying and prioritizing essential standards using systematic criteria
- **Endurance, Leverage, Readiness:** The three filters for determining essentials
- **Guaranteed and Viable Curriculum:** Teaching all standards but guaranteeing mastery of essentials
- **Team-Based Decision Making:** Using protocols and criteria rather than individual preferences

### Likely Outcomes

If Sarah implements this coaching advice:
- **Short-term:** Team will successfully identify 12-15 essential standards within 2-3 meetings
- **Medium-term:** Team will have clearer focus for assessment and intervention
- **Long-term:** Student mastery of core concepts will improve due to deeper instruction on essentials
- **Professional Growth:** Sarah is developing facilitation skills and deeper understanding of PLCs

### Potential Challenges Ahead

1. **Team resistance:** Some teachers may still resist "choosing" essentials
2. **Administrative pressure:** Principal might push back on "only" 12-15 essentials
3. **Unpacking standards:** Next step (defining proficiency) is equally challenging
4. **Assessment design:** Creating quality CFAs requires new skills

The coach has positioned Sarah well to address these challenges by providing clear rationale and protocols.

## Reflection Questions for Coaches

1. How did the coach balance providing information with building Sarah's capacity to lead her team?

2. What evidence suggests Sarah's understanding deepened over the course of the conversation?

3. How might this conversation have been different if Sarah had been resistant to the idea of essential standards rather than just overwhelmed?

4. What follow-up coaching might Sarah need after her team meeting?

5. How did the coach maintain focus on Question 1 without getting sidetracked into Questions 2-4?
