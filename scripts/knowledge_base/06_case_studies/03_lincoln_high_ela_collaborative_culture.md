# Lincoln High School ELA: From Isolation to Collaboration

## Context

**Lincoln High School** - Grades 9-12, 1,200 students, suburban
**ELA Department** - 9 teachers, varying experience (2-25 years)

**Starting Point (2022):**
- Teachers worked in complete isolation
- No common assessments
- No shared curriculum or pacing
- Department meetings focused on textbook selection and field trips
- Student outcomes inconsistent across teachers
- New teachers struggled without support

---

## The Problem

### Teacher Autonomy as Barrier

**Department culture:** "Good teachers have autonomy to teach however they want"

**Results:**
- Students in Room 201 (Mr. Adams) had vastly different experiences than students in Room 205 (Ms. Rodriguez)
- No guaranteed curriculum - depended entirely on which teacher you got
- Juniors taking AP English shocked by expectations because their 9th-10th grade experiences varied wildly
- Department chair frustrated: "We call ourselves a department but we're just 9 people teaching in the same building"

### Catalyst for Change

**Spring 2022:** District mandated common end-of-course writing assessments for grades 9-11

**Teacher reaction:** "They want us all to give the same assessment? But we don't teach the same content!"

**Principal's response:** "That's the problem. We need guaranteed curriculum for all students."

## Year 1: Building Trust & Collaboration (2022-2023)

### Fall 2022: Difficult Beginnings

**First Department PLC Meeting (August):**
Principal announced: "You'll meet weekly to develop common assessments and curriculum."

**Teacher pushback:**
- "This eliminates teacher autonomy"
- "My students are different - one-size-fits-all won't work"
- "We've never done this before"

**Department Chair (Ms. Chen) to Principal:** "If you mandate this from the top down, you'll get compliance but not commitment. Let me work with the team."

### Building Foundation

**Ms. Chen's Approach:**

**Step 1: Develop Norms (September)**
- Full meeting dedicated to: "How do we want to work together?"
- Norms included: "Assume positive intent," "Challenge ideas, not people," "Start and end on time"

**Step 2: Start Small (October-November)**
- Didn't try to revamp entire curriculum
- Focused on ONE common assessment: 9th grade argument essay
- All teachers contribute items/prompts
- Collaborate on scoring rubric

**Step 3: Calibration Activity (December)**
- Team scored 6 student essays together
- Realized they defined "proficiency" very differently
- Worked through disagreements respectfully
- Developed anchor papers

**Breakthrough Moment:**
Mr. Adams (20-year veteran, initially resistant): "I've been teaching argument writing for two decades. But looking at these anchor papers, I realize I've been focused on grammar while others focus on reasoning. No wonder students are confused when they move from my class to the next level."

### Winter 2023: First Common Assessment

**January:** All 9th grade students wrote argument essay (same prompt, same rubric)

**Data Analysis Meeting:**
- Results ranged from 52% to 78% proficient across teachers
- Instead of defensiveness, genuine curiosity: "What's working in Room 205 that we could learn from?"

**Ms. Rodriguez shared her strategy:**
- Explicitly teaching claim-evidence-reasoning structure
- Using mentor texts to show strong arguments
- Multiple low-stakes drafts with feedback

**Result:** Other teachers tried her approach. Next CFA (March), proficiency rose across all classes.

### Spring 2023: Expanding Collaboration

**What started with one assessment expanded:**
- 9th grade: Common assessments on argument, informational, and narrative writing
- 10th grade: Started developing common assessments
- Teachers sharing lesson plans, rubrics, strategies
- Weekly meetings focused on student learning, not logistics

**Year 1 Outcomes:**
- 9th grade writing proficiency: 58% → 71% (13-point gain)
- Teacher relationships stronger
- New teachers (hired mid-year) integrated smoothly with existing structures
- Culture shifting from "my students" to "our students"

---

## Year 2: Deepening & Expanding (2023-2024)

### Fall 2023: Systematic Approach

**Grade 9-11 common assessments established:**
- Each grade: 3 writing CFAs + 2 reading comprehension CFAs per semester
- Scoring calibrated through anchor papers
- Data analysis protocols used for all CFAs

**Extension:**
- 11th grade team developed challenge option for proficient writers
- Instead of "more writing," students analyzed published arguments for rhetorical choices

### Cross-Grade Collaboration

**New Practice:** "Vertical team meetings" twice per semester
- 9th grade teachers met with 10th grade teachers: "What do students need to be ready for you?"
- 10th met with 11th, etc.
- Result: Better alignment, less repetition, smoother transitions

### Mid-Year Results

**Writing Proficiency (December 2023):**
- Grade 9: 76% proficient
- Grade 10: 72% proficient
- Grade 11: 79% proficient

**Even more significant:** Consistency across teachers within grade level
- Grade 9: All teachers now 72-80% proficiency (vs. 52-78% two years ago)
- This meant guaranteed curriculum was actually happening

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Respecting Teacher Expertise

**Ms. Chen's Leadership:**
- Didn't frame collaboration as "fixing bad teachers"
- Positioned as "leveraging collective expertise"
- Celebrated what each teacher brought

### 2. Starting Small

**Not:** "Revamp everything at once"
**Instead:** "One assessment, one grade level, build from there"

**Result:** Success built confidence for expanding

### 3. Using Protocols

**Data meetings used structured protocols:**
- Prevented meetings from becoming defensive
- Ensured focus on student learning
- Made collaboration feel safe

### 4. Building on Strengths

**When Ms. Rodriguez's students performed well:**
Team response: "What can we learn from you?"
**Not:** "Why are others' students struggling?"

**Frame:** Collaboration as learning opportunity, not evaluation

### 5. Principal Support

**Principal's role:**
- Protected 60-minute weekly collaboration time
- Attended meetings occasionally (as learner, not evaluator)
- Publicly celebrated department's progress
- Didn't micromanage how team collaborated

## Challenges & How They Were Addressed

### Challenge 1: Veteran Teacher Resistance

**Mr. Adams (25 years experience):** "I've always taught my way. Why change now?"

**Response:** Not forced compliance. Instead:
- Invited him to share his expertise (he had great strategies)
- Showed data: inconsistency across teachers hurt students
- Gave time to see collaboration benefits before fully buying in
- Eventually became advocate: "I wish we'd done this 20 years ago"

### Challenge 2: Time Constraints

**Teachers:** "We barely have time to plan our own classes. Now we're planning together?"

**Reality check:** Collaboration initially took MORE time.

**Long-term:** Sharing resources, common assessments, collaborative problem-solving actually saved time.

**Year 2:** Teachers spending same or LESS time planning because of shared resources.

### Challenge 3: Balancing Common & Individual

**Concern:** "Will collaboration eliminate creativity?"

**Solution:**
- Common essential assessments and standards
- HOW teachers taught remained flexible
- Teachers still brought individual strengths/style
- Collaboration enhanced, didn't eliminate, autonomy

---

## Current Status (2024-2025)

**Year 3 Developments:**
- All grades 9-11 have common assessments in writing and reading
- 12th grade starting common assessments this year
- Department known in district as model for collaboration
- Teacher retention high (used to have turnover, now people want to work there)
- Student AP English scores improved (better preparation in 9-11)

**Ms. Chen:** "Two years ago we were 9 people working alone. Now we're a real department - a team. Our students benefit because they get guaranteed high-quality instruction no matter whose class they're in."

**Mr. Adams:** "I was the biggest skeptic. Now I can't imagine going back to working in isolation. Collaboration makes me a better teacher."

## Lessons Learned

**What worked:**
- Building trust through norms and respect
- Starting small and building progressively
- Using protocols to make collaboration productive
- Celebrating teacher expertise, not exposing weaknesses
- Patient leadership allowing culture to develop

**What didn't work initially:**
- Top-down mandate (principal learned to step back)
- Trying to do too much at once (initial overwhelm)
- Meetings without structure (early meetings were unfocused)

**Advice for other high schools:**
"High school teachers are used to autonomy. You can't force collaboration - you have to build trust first. Start with something small where teachers can see clear benefits. Use protocols so collaboration feels productive, not like more meetings. Be patient - culture change takes time."

## Reflection Questions

1. What role did department chair leadership play in transformation?
2. How did the team balance teacher autonomy with guaranteed curriculum?
3. Why was starting small with one assessment more effective than trying to revamp everything?
4. How might this approach transfer to other content departments?
