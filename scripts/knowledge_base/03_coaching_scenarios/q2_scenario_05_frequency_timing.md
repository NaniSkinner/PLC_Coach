# Coaching Scenario: Determining CFA Frequency and Timing

## Context

James teaches 10th-grade English and his team is planning their CFA schedule for the semester. Some teachers want to assess every two weeks ("more data is better"), while others worry that's too much testing and want monthly assessments. They're also unsure when to give CFAs - before moving to the next unit? Midway through units? They need guidance on assessment frequency and timing.

**Team:** 4 English 10 teachers, semester-long curriculum covering 5 major units

**Debate:** How often to assess and when within instructional cycle

## The Coaching Conversation

### Turn 1: Teacher Opens

**James:** Our team is having a debate about how often to give common formative assessments. We teach five major units this semester - argument writing, literary analysis, research skills, vocabulary/grammar, and speaking/listening.

One teacher wants to give a CFA every two weeks - she says we need frequent data to identify struggling students quickly. Another teacher says that's way too much - students will be constantly testing and we'll lose instructional time. He wants one CFA per unit, so five assessments total over 18 weeks.

I see both perspectives. How do we decide what's right?

**Coach Response:**

This is a great question and there's not one right answer for all contexts. The frequency depends on several factors. Let me ask you some questions that will help your team decide:

First, what's the purpose of your CFAs? Are they to monitor progress DURING instruction so you can adjust, or to evaluate mastery AFTER instruction is complete?

### Turn 2-8: [Conversation continues with coach helping James consider:]

**Purpose-Driven Frequency:**
- Formative (during learning) = more frequent, shorter assessments
- Summative (after learning) = less frequent, comprehensive assessments
- CFAs should be formative by definition

**Practical Factors:**
- **Length of instructional cycle**: 2-week skill (assess week 2), 6-week unit (assess weeks 2, 4, 6)
- **Complexity of content**: More complex = more checkpoints needed
- **Time to respond**: No point assessing if no time to intervene before moving on
- **Assessment burden**: Balance data needs with instructional time

**Recommended Framework:**
- **Quick checks** (5-10 min): Every 1-2 weeks - informal, identifies who needs immediate help
- **CFAs** (20-30 min): Every 3-4 weeks - formal, team analyzes together
- **Unit assessments** (45-60 min): End of major unit - summative data

**Timing Within Units:**
- Week 1-2: Initial instruction
- Week 3: First CFA (identifies who needs intervention)
- Week 3-4: Intervention + continued instruction
- Week 5: Second CFA (checks intervention effectiveness)
- Week 6: Unit assessment

**For James's Context:**
- 18 weeks, 5 units = roughly 3-4 weeks per unit
- Suggests 1-2 CFAs per unit = 8-10 CFAs for semester
- Mix of shorter (15-min) checks and longer (30-min) CFAs

**Coach's Key Point:** "Frequency isn't about more vs. less testing. It's about having data in time to respond. If you assess too infrequently, students fail before you can intervene. If you assess too frequently, you lose instructional time. The sweet spot is assessing frequently enough to catch struggles early, but not so often that it overwhelms instruction."

**Outcome:** Team agrees to assess 1-2 times per unit depending on unit length. For 3-week units, one CFA mid-unit. For 6-week units, CFAs at weeks 2 and 4. This gives them 8 CFAs for the semester - one every 2-3 weeks on average, with time to intervene between assessments.

## Coaching Analysis

### Key Coaching Moves
- Asked purpose-driven questions rather than giving formulaic answer
- Provided framework for thinking through frequency, not just "right answer"
- Distinguished between quick checks, CFAs, and unit assessments
- Helped team consider their specific context (unit length, content complexity)

### PLC Concepts
- Formative assessment purpose: inform instruction during learning
- Time as variable: Leave time to intervene before moving on
- Data cycles: Assess → Analyze → Respond → Reassess
- Balance: Enough data to inform, not so much it overwhelms

### Likely Outcomes
- Team will implement 8-10 CFAs for semester
- Assessment timing will allow intervention before unit ends
- Students will receive timely support based on data
- Team will adjust frequency based on experience

## Reflection Questions
1. What factors should teams consider when determining CFA frequency?
2. How is CFA timing related to intervention effectiveness?
3. What's the difference between quick checks and formal CFAs?
